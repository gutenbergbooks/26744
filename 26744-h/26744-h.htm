<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE POWER OF PRAYER</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE following account of some of the experiences
which eventually led to the formation of the <span class="smcap">China
Inland Mission</span>, and to its taking the form in which it has
been developed, first appeared in the pages of <i>China's
Millions</i>. Many of those who read it there asked that it
might appear in separate form. Miss Guinness incorporated
it in the <i>Story of the China Inland Mission</i>, a record which
contained the account of <span class="smcap">God's</span> goodness to the beginning
of 1894. But friends still asking for it in pamphlet form,
for wider distribution, this edition is brought out.</div>

<p>Much of the material was taken from notes of addresses
given in China during a conference of our missionaries;
this will account for the direct and narrative form of the
papers, which it has not been thought necessary to change.</p>

<p>It is always helpful to us to fix our attention on the
<span class="smcap">God</span>-ward aspect of Christian work; to realise that the work
of <span class="smcap">God</span> does not mean so much man's work for <span class="smcap">God</span>, as
<span class="smcap">God's</span> own work through man. Furthermore, in our privileged
position of fellow-workers with Him, while fully recognising
all the benefits and blessings to be bestowed on a
sin-stricken world through the proclamation of the Gospel
and spread of the Truth, we should never lose sight of the
higher aspect of our work&mdash;that of obedience to <span class="smcap">God</span>, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
bringing glory to His Name, of gladdening the heart of
our <span class="smcap">God</span> and <span class="smcap">Father</span> by living and serving as His beloved
children.</p>

<p>Many circumstances connected with my own early life
and service presented this aspect of work vividly to me;
and as I think of some of them, I am reminded of how
much the cause of missions is indebted to many who are
never themselves permitted to see the mission field&mdash;many,
it may be, who are unable to give largely of their
substance, and who will be not a little surprised in the
Great Day to see how much the work has been advanced
by their love, their sympathy, and their prayers.</p>

<p>For myself, and for the work that I have been permitted
to do for <span class="smcap">God</span>, I owe an unspeakable debt of gratitude to
my beloved and honoured parents, who have passed away
and entered into rest, but the influence of whose lives will
never pass away.</p>

<p>Many years ago, probably about 1830, the heart of
my dear father, then himself an earnest and successful
evangelist at home, was deeply stirred as to the spiritual
state of China by reading several books, and especially
an account of the travels of Captain Basil Hall. His
circumstances were such as to preclude the hope of his
ever going to China for personal service, but he was led
to pray that if <span class="smcap">God</span> should give him a son, he might be
called and privileged to labour in the vast needy empire
which was then apparently so sealed against the truth.
I was not aware of this desire or prayer myself until my
return to England, more than seven years after I had
sailed for China; but it was very interesting then to know
how prayer offered before my birth had been answered in
this matter.</p>

<p>All thought of my becoming a missionary was abandoned
for many years by my dear parents on account of the feebleness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of my health. When the time came, however, <span class="smcap">God</span>
gave increased health, and my life has been spared, and
strength has been given for not a little toilsome service
both in the mission field and at home, while many stronger
men and women have succumbed.</p>

<p>I had many opportunities in early years of learning
the value of prayer and of the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>; for it
was the delight of my dear parents to point out that if
there were any such Being as <span class="smcap">God</span>, to trust Him, to obey
Him, and to be fully given up to His service, must of
necessity be the best and wisest course both for myself
and others. But in spite of these helpful examples and
precepts my heart was unchanged. Often I had tried to
make myself a Christian; and failing of course in such
efforts, I began at last to think that for some reason or
other I could not be saved, and that the best I could
do was to take my fill of this world, as there was no
hope for me beyond the grave.</p>

<p>While in this state of mind I came in contact with
persons holding sceptical and infidel views, and accepted
their teaching, only too thankful for some hope of escape
from the doom which, if my parents were right and the
Bible true, awaited the impenitent. It may seem strange
to say it, but I have often felt thankful for the experience
of this time of scepticism. The inconsistencies of Christian
people, who while professing to believe their Bibles were
yet content to live just as they would if there were no
such book, had been one of the strongest arguments
of my sceptical companions; and I frequently felt at
that time, and said, that if I pretended to believe the
Bible I would at any rate attempt to live by it, putting
it fairly to the test, and if it failed to prove true and reliable,
would throw it overboard altogether. These views I
retained when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was pleased to bring me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Himself; and I think I may say that since then I <i>have</i> put
<span class="smcap">God's</span> Word to the test. Certainly it has never failed me.
I have never had reason to regret the confidence I have
placed in its promises, or to deplore following the guidance
I have found in its directions.</p>

<p>Let me tell you how <span class="smcap">God</span> answered the prayers of my
dear mother and of my beloved sister, now Mrs. Broomhall,
for my conversion. On a day which I shall never forget,
when I was about fifteen years of age, my dear mother
being absent from home, I had a holiday, and in the afternoon
looked through my father's library to find some book
with which to while away the unoccupied hours. Nothing
attracting me, I turned over a little basket of pamphlets,
and selected from amongst them a Gospel tract which
looked interesting, saying to myself, "There will be a
story at the commencement, and a sermon or moral at the
close: I will take the former and leave the latter for those
who like it."</p>

<p>I sat down to read the little book in an utterly unconcerned
state of mind, believing indeed at the time that if
there were any salvation it was not for me, and with a distinct
intention to put away the tract as soon as it should
seem prosy. I may say that it was not uncommon in
those days to call conversion "becoming serious"; and
judging by the faces of some of its professors, it appeared
to be a very serious matter indeed. Would it not be well
if the people of <span class="smcap">God</span> had always tell-tale faces, evincing
the blessings and gladness of salvation so clearly that
unconverted people might have to call conversion "becoming
joyful" instead of "becoming serious"?</p>

<p>Little did I know at the time what was going on in
the heart of my dear mother, seventy or eighty miles away.
She rose from the dinner-table that afternoon with an
intense yearning for the conversion of her boy, and feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that&mdash;absent from home, and having more leisure than she
could otherwise secure&mdash;a special opportunity was afforded
her of pleading with <span class="smcap">God</span> on my behalf. She went to
her room and turned the key in the door, resolved not
to leave that spot until her prayers were answered. Hour
after hour did that dear mother plead for me, until at
length she could pray no longer, but was constrained to
praise <span class="smcap">God</span> for that which His <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> taught her had
already been accomplished&mdash;the conversion of her only son.</p>

<p>I in the meantime had been led in the way I have
mentioned to take up this little tract, and while reading
it was struck with the sentence, "The finished work of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>." The thought passed through my mind, "Why
does the author use this expression? why not say the
atoning or propitiatory work of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>?" Immediately the
words "It is finished" suggested themselves to my mind.
What was finished? And I at once replied, "A full and
perfect atonement and satisfaction for sin: the debt was
paid by the Substitute; <span class="smcap">Christ</span> died for our sins, and not
for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
Then came the thought, "If the whole work was finished
and the whole debt paid, what is there left for me to
do?" And with this dawned the joyful conviction, as
light was flashed into my soul by the <span class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>, that
there was nothing in the world to be done but to fall
down on one's knees, and accepting this <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and
His salvation, to praise Him for evermore. Thus while
my dear mother was praising <span class="smcap">God</span> on her knees in her
chamber, I was praising Him in the old warehouse to
which I had gone alone to read at my leisure this little
book.</p>

<p>Several days elapsed ere I ventured to make my beloved
sister the confidante of my joy, and then only after she
had promised not to tell any one of my soul secret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
When our dear mother came home a fortnight later, I was
the first to meet her at the door, and to tell her I had
such glad news to give. I can almost feel that dear
mother's arms around my neck, as she pressed me to her
bosom and said, "I know, my boy; I have been rejoicing
for a fortnight in the glad tidings you have to tell me."
"Why," I asked in surprise, "has Amelia broken her
promise? She said she would tell no one." My dear
mother assured me that it was not from any human
source that she had learned the tidings, and went on
to tell the little incident mentioned above. You will
agree with me that it would be strange indeed if I were
not a believer in the power of prayer.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Some little time after, I picked up
a pocket-book exactly like one of my own, and thinking
that it was mine, opened it. The lines that caught my
eye were an entry in the little diary, which belonged to
my sister, to the effect that she would give herself daily
to prayer until <span class="smcap">God</span> should answer in the conversion of her
brother. Exactly one month later the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was pleased
to turn me from darkness to light.</p>

<p>Brought up in such a circle and saved under such
circumstances, it was perhaps natural that from the commencement
of my Christian life I was led to feel that the
promises were very real, and that prayer was in sober matter
of fact transacting business with <span class="smcap">God</span>, whether on one's
own behalf or on behalf of those for whom one sought His
blessing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE CALL TO SERVICE</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE first joys of conversion passed away after a time,
and were succeeded by a period of painful deadness
of soul, with much conflict. But this also came to an end,
leaving a deepened sense of personal weakness and dependence
on the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> as the only <span class="smcap">Keeper</span> as well as <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
of His people. How sweet to the soul, wearied and disappointed
in its struggles with sin, is the calm repose of
trust in the <span class="smcap">Shepherd</span> of Israel.</div>

<p>Not many months after my conversion, having a leisure
afternoon, I retired to my own chamber to spend it largely
in communion with <span class="smcap">God</span>. Well do I remember that
occasion. How in the gladness of my heart I poured out
my soul before <span class="smcap">God</span>; and again and again confessing my
grateful love to Him who had done everything for me&mdash;who
had saved me when I had given up all hope and even
desire for salvation&mdash;I besought Him to give me some
work to do for Him, as an outlet for love and gratitude;
some self-denying service, no matter what it might be,
however trying or however trivial; something with which
He would be pleased, and that I might do for Him who
had done so much for me. Well do I remember, as in
unreserved consecration I put myself, my life, my friends,
my all, upon the altar, the deep solemnity that came over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
my soul with the assurance that my offering was accepted.
The presence of <span class="smcap">God</span> became unutterably real and blessed;
and though but a child under sixteen, I remember stretching
myself on the ground, and lying there silent before Him
with unspeakable awe and unspeakable joy.</p>

<p>For what service I was accepted I knew not; but a
deep consciousness that I was no longer my own took
possession of me, which has never since been effaced. It
has been a very practical consciousness. Two or three
years later propositions of an unusually favourable nature
were made to me with regard to medical study, on the
condition of my becoming apprenticed to the medical man
who was my friend and teacher. But I felt I dared not
accept any binding engagement such as was suggested. I
was not my own to give myself away; for I knew not
when or how He whose alone I was, and for whose disposal
I felt I must ever keep myself free, might call for service.</p>

<p>Within a few months of this time of consecration the
impression was wrought into my soul that it was in China
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> wanted me. It seemed to me highly probable
that the work to which I was thus called might cost my life;
for China was not then open as it is now. But few missionary
societies had at that time workers in China, and
but few books on the subject of China missions were
accessible to me. I learned, however, that the Congregational
minister of my native town possessed a copy
of Medhurst's <i>China</i>, and I called upon him to ask a
loan of the book. This he kindly granted, asking me
why I wished to read it. I told him that <span class="smcap">God</span> had called
me to spend my life in missionary service in that land.
"And how do you propose to go there?" he inquired. I
answered that I did not at all know; that it seemed to
me probable that I should need to do as the Twelve
and the Seventy had done in Jud&aelig;a&mdash;go without purse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or scrip, relying on Him who had called me to supply
all my need. Kindly placing his hand upon my shoulder,
the minister replied, "Ah, my boy, as you grow older you
will get wiser than that. Such an idea would do very
well in the days when <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself was on earth, but
not now."</p>

<p>I have grown older since then, but not wiser. I am
more than ever convinced that if we were to take the
directions of our <span class="smcap">Master</span> and the assurances He gave to
His first disciples more fully as our guide, we should find
them to be just as suited to our times as to those in
which they were originally given.</p>

<p>Medhurst's book on China emphasised the value of
medical missions there, and this directed my attention to
medical studies as a valuable mode of preparation.</p>

<p>My beloved parents neither discouraged nor encouraged
my desire to engage in missionary work. They advised
me, with such convictions, to use all the means in my
power to develop the resources of body, mind, heart, and
soul, and to wait prayerfully upon <span class="smcap">God</span>, quite willing,
should He show me that I was mistaken, to follow His
guidance, or to go forward if in due time He should open
the way to missionary service. The importance of this
advice I have often since had occasion to prove. I began
to take more exercise in the open air to strengthen my
physique. My feather bed I had taken away, and sought
to dispense with as many other home comforts as I could,
in order to prepare myself for rougher lines of life. I
began also to do what Christian work was in my power, in
the way of tract distribution, Sunday-school teaching, and
visiting the poor and sick, as opportunity afforded.</p>

<p>After a time of preparatory study at home, I went to
Hull for medical and surgical training. There I became
assistant to a doctor who was connected with the Hull<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
school of medicine, and was surgeon also to a number
of factories, which brought many accident cases to our
dispensary, and gave me the opportunity of seeing and
practising the minor operations of surgery.</p>

<p>And here an event took place that I must not omit
to mention. Before leaving home my attention was drawn
to the subject of setting apart the firstfruits of all one's
increase and a proportionate part of one's possessions to
the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> service. I thought it well to study the
question with my Bible in hand before I went away from
home, and was placed in circumstances which might bias
my conclusions by the pressure of surrounding wants and
cares. I was thus led to the determination to set apart
not less than one-tenth of whatever moneys I might earn or
become possessed of for the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> service. The salary I
received as medical assistant in Hull at the time now
referred to would have allowed me with ease to do this.
But owing to changes in the family of my kind friend and
employer, it was necessary for me to reside out of doors.
Comfortable quarters were secured with a relative, and
in addition to the sum determined on as remuneration
for my services I received the exact amount I had to pay
for board and lodging.</p>

<p>Now arose in my mind the question, Ought not this
sum also to be tithed? It was surely a part of my income,
and I felt that if it had been a question of Government
income tax it certainly would not have been excluded.
On the other hand, to take a tithe from the whole would
not leave me sufficient for other purposes; and for some
little time I was much embarrassed to know what to do.
After much thought and prayer I was led to leave the
comfortable quarters and happy circle in which I was
now residing, and to engage a little lodging in the
suburbs&mdash;a sitting-room and bedroom in one&mdash;undertaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to board myself. In this way I was able without
difficulty to tithe the whole of my income; and while I
felt the change a good deal, it was attended with no small
blessing.</p>

<p>More time was given in my solitude to the study of
the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>, to visiting the poor, and to evangelistic
work on summer evenings than would otherwise have
been the case. Brought into contact in this way with
many who were in distress, I soon saw the privilege of
still further economising, and found it not difficult to give
away much more than the proportion of my income I had
at first intended.</p>

<p>About this time a friend drew my attention to the
question of the personal and pre-millennial coming of our
<span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, and gave me a list of passages
bearing upon it, without note or comment, advising me
to ponder the subject. For a while I gave much time to
studying the Scriptures about it, with the result that I was
led to see that this same <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> who left our earth in His
resurrection body was so to come again, that His feet
were to stand on the Mount of Olives, and that He was
to take possession of the temporal throne of His father
David which was promised before His birth. I saw,
further, that all through the New Testament the coming
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was the great hope of His people, and
was always appealed to as the strongest motive for consecration
and service, and as the greatest comfort in trial
and affliction. I learned, too, that the period of His
return for His people was not revealed, and that it was
their privilege, from day to day and from hour to hour,
to live as men who wait for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; that thus living
it was immaterial, so to speak, whether He should or
should not come at any particular hour, the important
thing being to be so ready for Him as to be able, whenever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
He might appear, to give an account of one's stewardship
with joy, and not with grief.</p>

<p>The effect of this blessed hope was a thoroughly
practical one. It led me to look carefully through my
little library to see if there were any books there that
were not needed or likely to be of further service, and
to examine my small wardrobe, to be quite sure that it
contained nothing that I should be sorry to give an account
of should the <span class="smcap">Master</span> come at once. The result was
that the library was considerably diminished, to the benefit
of some poor neighbours, and to the far greater benefit of
my own and that I found I had articles of clothing
also which might be put to better advantage in other
directions.</p>

<p>It has been very helpful to me from time to time
through life, as occasion has served, to act again in a
similar way; and I have never gone through my house,
from basement to attic, with this object in view, without
receiving a great accession of spiritual joy and blessing. I
believe we are all in danger of accumulating&mdash;it may be
from thoughtlessness, or from pressure of occupation&mdash;things
which would be useful to others, while not needed
by ourselves, and the retention of which entails loss of
blessing. If the whole resources of the Church of <span class="smcap">God</span>
were well utilised, how much more might be accomplished!
How many poor might be fed and naked clothed, and to
how many of those as yet unreached the Gospel might be
carried! Let me advise this line of things as a constant
habit of mind, and a profitable course to be practically
adopted whenever circumstances permit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>PREPARATION FOR SERVICE</h3>


<div class='cap'>HAVING now the twofold object in view of accustoming
myself to endure hardness, and of economising
in order to be able more largely to assist those amongst
whom I spent a good deal of time labouring in the Gospel,
I soon found that I could live upon very much less than I
had previously thought possible. Butter, milk, and other
such luxuries I soon ceased to use; and I found that by
living mainly on oatmeal and rice, with occasional variations,
a very small sum was sufficient for my needs. In this way
I had more than two-thirds of my income available for
other purposes; and my experience was that the less I
spent on myself and the more I gave away, the fuller of
happiness and blessing did my soul become. Unspeakable
joy all the day long, and every day, was my happy
experience. <span class="smcap">God</span>, even my <span class="smcap">God</span>, was a living, bright
Reality; and all I had to do was joyful service.</div>

<p>It was to me a very grave matter, however, to contemplate
going out to China, far away from all human aid,
there to depend upon the living <span class="smcap">God</span> alone for protection,
supplies, and help of every kind. I felt that one's spiritual
muscles required strengthening for such an undertaking.
There was no doubt that if faith did not fail, <span class="smcap">God</span> would
not fail; but, then, what if one's faith should prove insufficient?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
I had not at that time learned that even "if
we believe not, He abideth faithful, He cannot deny Himself";
and it was consequently a very serious question to
my mind, not whether <i>He</i> was faithful, but whether I
had strong enough faith to warrant my embarking in the
enterprise set before me.</p>

<p>I thought to myself, "When I get out to China, I shall
have no claim on any one for anything; my only claim will
be on <span class="smcap">God</span>. How important, therefore, to learn before
leaving England to move man, through <span class="smcap">God</span>, by prayer
alone."</p>

<p>At Hull my kind employer, always busily occupied,
wished me to remind him whenever my salary became
due. This I determined not to do directly, but to ask that
<span class="smcap">God</span> would bring the fact to his recollection, and thus encourage
me by answering prayer. At one time, as the day
drew near for the payment of a quarter's salary, I was as
usual much in prayer about it. The time arrived, but my
kind friend made no allusion to the matter. I continued
praying, and days passed on, but he did not remember,
until at length, on settling up my weekly accounts one
Saturday night, I found myself possessed of only a single
coin&mdash;one half-crown piece. Still I had hitherto had no
lack, and I continued in prayer.</p>

<p>That Sunday was a very happy one. As usual my heart
was full and brimming over with blessing. After attending
Divine service in the morning, my afternoons and
evenings were filled with Gospel work, in the various
lodging-houses I was accustomed to visit in the lowest
part of the town. At such times it almost seemed to me
as if heaven were begun below, and that all that could
be looked for was an enlargement of one's capacity for
joy, not a truer filling than I possessed. After concluding
my last service about ten o'clock that night, a poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
man asked me to go and pray with his wife, saying that
she was dying. I readily agreed, and on the way to his
house asked him why he had not sent for the priest, as
his accent told me he was an Irishman. He had done so,
he said, but the priest refused to come without a payment
of eighteenpence, which the man did not possess, as the
family was starving. Immediately it occurred to my mind
that all the money I had in the world was the solitary half-crown,
and that it was in one coin; moreover, that while
the basin of water gruel I usually took for supper was
awaiting me, and there was sufficient in the house for
breakfast in the morning, I certainly had nothing for
dinner on the coming day.</p>

<p>Somehow or other there was at once a stoppage in the
flow of joy in my heart; but instead of reproving myself I
began to reprove the poor man, telling him that it was
very wrong to have allowed matters to get into such a state
as he described, and that he ought to have applied to the
relieving officer. His answer was that he had done so, and
was told to come at eleven o'clock the next morning, but
that he feared that his wife might not live through the
night. "Ah," thought I, "if only I had two shillings
and a sixpence instead of this half-crown, how gladly
would I give these poor people one shilling of it!" But to
part with the half-crown was far from my thoughts. I
little dreamed that the real truth of the matter simply
was that I could trust in <span class="smcap">God</span> plus one-and-sixpence, but
was not yet prepared to trust Him only, without any
money at all in my pocket.</p>

<p>My conductor led me into a court, down which I
followed him with some degree of nervousness. I had
found myself there before, and at my last visit had
been very roughly handled, while my tracts were torn to
pieces, and I received such a warning not to come again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that I felt more than a little concerned. Still, it was the
path of duty, and I followed on. Up a miserable flight
of stairs, into a wretched room, he led me; and oh what
a sight there presented itself to our eyes! Four or five
poor children stood about, their sunken cheeks and
temples all telling unmistakably the story of slow starvation;
and lying on a wretched pallet was a poor exhausted
mother, with a tiny infant thirty-six hours old, moaning
rather than crying at her side, for it too seemed spent and
failing. "Ah!" thought I, "if I had two shillings and a
sixpence instead of half-a-crown, how gladly should they
have one-and-sixpence of it!" But still a wretched unbelief
prevented me from obeying the impulse to relieve
their distress at the cost of all I possessed.</p>

<p>It will scarcely seem strange that I was unable to say
much to comfort these poor people. I needed comfort
myself. I began to tell them, however, that they must not
be cast down, that though their circumstances were very
distressing, there was a kind and loving <span class="smcap">Father</span> in
heaven; but something within me said, "You hypocrite!
telling these unconverted people about a kind and loving
<span class="smcap">Father</span> in heaven, and not prepared yourself to trust Him
without half-a-crown!" I was nearly choked. How gladly
would I have compromised with conscience if I had had a
florin and a sixpence! I would have given the florin thankfully
and kept the rest; but I was not yet prepared to
trust in <span class="smcap">God</span> alone, without the sixpence.</p>

<p>To talk was impossible under these circumstances;
yet, strange to say, I thought I should have no difficulty
in praying. Prayer was a delightful occupation to me in
those days; time thus spent never seemed wearisome, and
I knew nothing of lack of words. I seemed to think that
all I should have to do would be to kneel down and
engage in prayer, and that relief would come to them and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to myself together. "You asked me to come and pray
with your wife," I said to the man, "let us pray." And I
knelt down. But scarcely had I opened my lips with "Our
<span class="smcap">Father</span> who art in heaven" than conscience said within,
"Dare you mock <span class="smcap">God</span>? Dare you kneel down and call
Him <span class="smcap">Father</span> with that half-crown in your pocket?"
Such a time of conflict came upon me then as I have
never experienced before or since. How I got through
that form of prayer I know not, and whether the words
uttered were connected or disconnected I cannot tell;
but I arose from my knees in great distress of mind.</p>

<p>The poor father turned to me and said, "You see what
a terrible state we are in, sir; if you can help us, for <span class="smcap">God's</span>
sake do!" Just then the word flashed into my mind,
"Give to him that asketh of thee," and in the word of a
<span class="smcap">King</span> there is power. I put my hand into my pocket,
and slowly drawing forth the half-crown, gave it to the man,
telling him that it might seem a small matter for me to relieve
them, seeing that I was comparatively well off, but that in
parting with that coin I was giving him my all; what I
had been trying to tell him was indeed true&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span> really
was a <span class="smcap">Father</span>, and might be trusted. The joy all came
back in full flood-tide to my heart; I could say anything
and feel it then, and the hindrance to blessing was gone&mdash;gone,
I trust, for ever.</p>

<p>Not only was the poor woman's life saved, but I realised
that my life was saved too! It might have been a wreck&mdash;would
have been a wreck probably, as a Christian life&mdash;had
not grace at that time conquered, and the striving
of <span class="smcap">God's Spirit</span> been obeyed. I well remember how that
night, as I went home to my lodgings, my heart was as light
as my pocket. The lonely, deserted streets resounded with
a hymn of praise which I could not restrain. When I took
my basin of gruel before retiring, I would not have exchanged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
it for a prince's feast. I reminded the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> as
I knelt at my bedside of His own Word, that he who giveth
to the poor lendeth to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>: I asked Him not to let
my loan be a long one, or I should have no dinner next
day; and with peace within and peace without, I spent a
happy, restful night.</p>

<p>Next morning for breakfast my plate of porridge remained,
and before it was consumed the postman's knock
was heard at the door. I was not in the habit of receiving
letters on Monday, as my parents and most of my
friends refrained from posting on Saturday; so that I was
somewhat surprised when the landlady came in holding a
letter or packet in her wet hand covered by her apron.
I looked at the letter, but could not make out the handwriting.
It was either a strange hand or a feigned one,
and the postmark was blurred. Where it came from I
could not tell. On opening the envelope I found nothing
written within; but inside a sheet of blank paper was
folded a pair of kid gloves, from which, as I opened them
in astonishment, half-a-sovereign fell to the ground. "Praise
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>!" I exclaimed; "400 per cent for twelve hours
investment; that is good interest. How glad the merchants
of Hull would be if they could lend their money at such
a rate!" I then and there determined that a bank which
could not break should have my savings or earnings as the
case might be&mdash;a determination I have not yet learned to
regret.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how often my mind has recurred to
this incident, or all the help it has been to me in circumstances
of difficulty in after-life. If we are faithful to <span class="smcap">God</span>
in little things, we shall gain experience and strength that
will be helpful to us in the more serious trials of life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>FURTHER ANSWERS TO PRAYER</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE remarkable and gracious deliverance I have spoken
of, was a great joy to me, as well as a strong confirmation
of faith; but of course ten shillings, however
economically used, will not go very far, and it was none
the less necessary to continue in prayer, asking that the
larger supply which was still due might be remembered and
paid. All my petitions, however, appeared to remain unanswered;
and before a fortnight had elapsed I found
myself pretty much in the same position that I had
occupied on the Sunday night already made so memorable.
Meanwhile, I continued pleading with <span class="smcap">God</span>, more
and more earnestly, that He would graciously remind
my employer that my salary was overdue. Of course it
was not the want of the money that distressed me&mdash;that
could have been had at any time for the asking&mdash;but the
question uppermost in my mind was this: "Can I go to
China? or will my want of faith and power with <span class="smcap">God</span> prove
to be so serious an obstacle as to preclude my entering
upon this much-prized service?"</div>

<p>As the week drew to a close I felt exceedingly embarrassed.
There was not only myself to consider; on
Saturday night a payment would be due to my Christian
landlady which I knew she could not well dispense with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Ought I not, for her sake, to speak about the matter of
the salary? Yet to do so would be, to myself at any
rate, the admission that I was not fitted to undertake a
missionary enterprise. I gave nearly the whole of Thursday
and Friday&mdash;all the time not occupied in my necessary
employment&mdash;to earnest wrestling with <span class="smcap">God</span> in prayer.
But still on Saturday morning I was in the same position
as before. And now my earnest cry was for guidance
as to whether it was my duty to break silence and speak
to my employer, or whether I should still continue to wait
the <span class="smcap">Father</span>'s time. As far as I could judge, I received the
assurance that to wait His time was best; and that <span class="smcap">God</span>
in some way or other would interpose on my behalf. So
I waited, my heart being now at rest and the burden gone.</p>

<p>About five o'clock that Saturday afternoon, when the
doctor had finished writing his prescriptions, his last
circuit for the day being taken, he threw himself back in
his arm-chair, as he was wont, and began to speak of the
things of <span class="smcap">God</span>. He was a truly Christian man, and many
seasons of very happy spiritual fellowship we had together.
I was busily watching, at the time, a pan in which a
decoction was boiling that required a good deal of attention.
It was indeed fortunate for me that it was so, for without
any obvious connection with what had been going on, all
at once he said, "By-the-bye, Taylor, is not your salary
due again?" My emotion may be imagined! I had to
swallow two or three times before I could answer. With
my eye fixed on the pan and my back to the doctor,
I told him as quietly as I could that it was overdue some
little time. How thankful I felt at that moment! <span class="smcap">God</span>
surely had heard my prayer, and caused him, in this
time of my great need, to remember the salary without
any word or suggestion from me. He replied, "Oh, I am
so sorry you did not remind me! You know how busy I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
am; I wish I had thought of it a little sooner, for only
this afternoon I sent all the money I had to the bank,
otherwise I would pay you at once." It is impossible to
describe the revulsion of feeling caused by this unexpected
statement. I knew not what to do. Fortunately for me
my pan boiled up, and I had a good reason for rushing with
it from the room. Glad indeed I was to get away, and
keep out of sight until after the doctor had returned to his
house, and most thankful that he had not perceived my
emotion.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone I had to seek my little
sanctum, and pour out my heart before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for some
time, before calmness&mdash;and more than calmness&mdash;thankfulness,
and joy were restored to me. I felt that <span class="smcap">God</span> had
His own way, and was not going to fail me. I had sought
to know His will early in the day, and as far as I could
judge had received guidance to wait patiently; and now
<span class="smcap">God</span> was going to work for me in some other way.</p>

<p>That evening was spent, as my Saturday evenings
usually were, in reading the Word and preparing the
subjects on which I expected to speak in the various
lodging-houses on the morrow. I waited, perhaps, a
little longer than usual. At last, about ten o'clock, there
being no interruption of any kind, I put on my overcoat,
and was preparing to leave for home, rather thankful
to know that by that time I should have to let myself
in with the latch-key, as my landlady retired early to
rest. There was certainly no help for that night; but
perhaps <span class="smcap">God</span> would interpose for me by Monday, and I
might be able to pay my landlady early in the week the
money I would have given her before, had it been possible.</p>

<p>Just as I was preparing to turn down the gas, I heard
the doctor's step in the garden which lay between the
dwelling-house and surgery. He was laughing to himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
very heartily, as though greatly amused by something.
Entering the surgery, he asked for the ledger, and told
me that, strange to say, one of his richest patients had
just come to pay his doctor's bill&mdash;was it not an odd
thing to do? It never struck me that it might have any
bearing on my own particular case, or I might have felt
embarrassed; but looking at it simply from the position of
an uninterested spectator, I also was highly amused that a
man who was rolling in wealth should come after ten
o'clock at night to pay a doctor's bill, which he could any
day have met by a cheque with the greatest ease. It
appeared that somehow or other he could not rest with
this on his mind, and had been constrained to come
at that unusual hour to discharge his liability.</p>

<p>The account was duly receipted in the ledger, and
the doctor was about to leave, when suddenly he turned,
and handing me some of the bank notes just received,
said, to my surprise and thankfulness, "By the way, Taylor,
you might as well take these notes; I have not any change,
but can give you the balance next week." Again I was
left&mdash;my feelings undiscovered&mdash;to go back to my own
little closet and praise the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with a joyful heart that
after all I might go to China.</p>

<p>To me this incident was not a trivial one; and to recall
it sometimes, in circumstances of great difficulty, in China
or elsewhere, has proved no small comfort and strength.</p>

<p>By-and-by the time drew near when it was thought desirable
that I should leave Hull to attend the medical course
of the London Hospital. A little while spent there, and
then I had every reason to believe that my life-work in
China would commence. But much as I had rejoiced
at the willingness of <span class="smcap">God</span> to hear and answer prayer and
to help His half-trusting, half-timid child, I felt that I
could not go to China without having still further developed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and tested my power to rest upon His faithfulness;
and a marked opportunity for doing so was providentially
afforded me.</p>

<p>My dear father had offered to bear all the expense of
my stay in London. I knew, however, that, owing to
recent losses, it would mean a considerable sacrifice for
him to undertake this just when it seemed necessary for
me to go forward. I had recently become acquainted
with the Committee of the Chinese Evangelisation Society,
in connection with which I ultimately left for China,
and especially with its secretary, my esteemed and much-loved
friend Mr. George Pearse, then of the Stock Exchange,
but now<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and for many years himself a missionary.
Not knowing of my father's proposition, the Committee
also kindly offered to bear my expenses while in London.
When these proposals were first made to me, I was not
quite clear as to what I ought to do, and in writing to
my father and the secretaries, told them that I would
take a few days to pray about the matter before deciding
any course of action. I mentioned to my father that
I had had this offer from the Society, and told the
secretaries also of his proffered aid.</p>

<p>Subsequently, while waiting upon <span class="smcap">God</span> in prayer for
guidance, it became clear to my mind that I could without
difficulty decline both offers. The secretaries of the
Society would not know that I had cast myself wholly
on <span class="smcap">God</span> for supplies, and my father would conclude that
I had accepted the other offer. I therefore wrote declining
both propositions, and felt that without any one having
either care or anxiety on my account I was simply in the
hands of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and that He, who knew my heart, if He
wished to encourage me to go to China, would bless my
effort to depend upon Him alone at home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>LIFE IN LONDON</h3>


<div class='cap'>I MUST not now attempt to detail the ways in which
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was pleased&mdash;often to my surprise, as well as
to my delight&mdash;to help me from time to time. I soon found
that it was not possible to live quite as economically in
London as in Hull. To lessen expenses I shared a room
with a cousin, four miles from the hospital, providing
myself with board; and after various experiments I found
that the most economical way was to live almost exclusively
on brown bread and water. Thus I was able to make the
means that <span class="smcap">God</span> gave me last as long as possible. Some
of my expenses I could not diminish, but my board was
largely within my own control. A large twopenny loaf of
brown bread, purchased daily on my long walk from the
hospital, furnished me with supper and breakfast; and on
that diet, with a few apples for lunch, I managed to walk
eight or nine miles a day, besides being a good deal on
foot while attending the practice of the hospital and the
medical school.</div>

<p>One incident that occurred just about this time I must
refer to. The husband of my former landlady in Hull was
chief officer of a ship that sailed from London, and by
receiving his half-pay monthly and remitting it to her I
was able to save her the cost of a commission. This I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
had been doing for several months, when she wrote requesting
that I would obtain the next payment as early as
possible, as her rent was almost due, and she depended
upon that sum to meet it. The request came at an
inconvenient time. I was working hard for an examination
in the hope of obtaining a scholarship which would
be of service to me, and felt that I could ill afford the
time to go during the busiest part of the day to the city
and procure the money. I had, however, sufficient of my
own in hand to enable me to send the required sum. I
made the remittance therefore, purposing, as soon as the
examination was over, to go and draw the regular allowance
with which to refund myself.</p>

<p>Before the time of examination the medical school
was closed for a day, on account of the funeral of the
Duke of Wellington, and I had an opportunity of going
at once to the office, which was situated in a street on
Cheapside, and applying for the due amount. To my
surprise and dismay the cleric told me that he could not
pay it, as the officer in question had run away from his
ship and gone to the gold diggings. "Well," I remarked,
"that is very inconvenient for me, as I have already
advanced the money, and I know his wife will have no
means of repaying it." The clerk said he was sorry, but
could of course only act according to orders; so there was
no help for me in that direction. A little more time and
thought, however, brought the comforting conclusion to my
mind, that as I was depending on the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for everything,
and His means were not limited, it was a small
matter to be brought a little sooner or later into the
position of needing fresh supplies from Him; and so the
joy and the peace were not long interfered with.</p>

<p>Very soon after this, possibly the same evening, while
sewing together some sheets of paper on which to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
notes of the lectures, I accidentally pricked the first finger
of my right hand, and in a few moments forgot all about
it. The next day at the hospital I continued dissecting
as before. The body was that of a person who had died
of fever, and was more than usually disagreeable and
dangerous. I need scarcely say that those of us who
were at work upon it dissected with special care, knowing
that the slightest scratch might cost us our lives. Before
the morning was far advanced I began to feel very weary,
and while going through the surgical wards at noon was
obliged to run out, being suddenly very sick&mdash;a most
unusual circumstance with me, as I took but little food
and nothing that could disagree with me. After feeling
faint for some time, a draught of cold water revived me,
and I was able to rejoin the students. I became more and
more unwell, however, and ere the afternoon lecture on
surgery was over found it impossible to hold the pencil and
continue taking notes. By the time the next lecture was
through, my whole arm and right side were full of severe
pain, and I was both looking and feeling very ill.</p>

<p>Finding that I could not resume work, I went into
the dissecting-room to bind up the portion I was engaged
upon and put away my apparatus, and said to the demonstrator,
who was a very skilful surgeon, "I cannot think what
has come over me," describing the symptoms. "Why,"
said he, "what has happened is clear enough: you must
have cut yourself in dissecting, and you know that this is a
case of malignant fever." I assured him that I had been
most careful, and was quite certain that I had no cut or
scratch. "Well," he replied, "you certainly must have
had one;" and he very closely scrutinised my hand to find
it, but in vain. All at once it occurred to me that I had
pricked my finger the night before, and I asked him if it
were possible that a prick from a needle, at that time, could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
have been still unclosed. His opinion was that this was
probably the cause of the trouble, and he advised me to
get a hansom, drive home as fast as I could, and arrange
my affairs forthwith. "For," he said, "you are a dead
man."</p>

<p>My first thought was one of sorrow that I could not go
to China; but very soon came the feeling, "Unless I am
greatly mistaken, I have work to do in China, and shall not
die." I was glad, however, to take the opportunity of
speaking to my medical friend, who was a confirmed
sceptic as to things spiritual, of the joy that the prospect
of perhaps soon being with my <span class="smcap">Master</span> gave me; telling
him at the same time that I did not think I should die, as,
unless I were much mistaken, I had work to do in China;
and if so, however severe the struggle, I must be brought
through. "That is all very well," he answered, "but you
get a hansom and drive home as fast as you can. You
have no time to lose, for you will soon be incapable of
winding up your affairs."</p>

<p>I smiled a little at the idea of my driving home in
a hansom, for by this time my means were too exhausted
to allow of such a proceeding, and I set out to walk the
distance if possible. Before long, however, my strength
gave way, and I felt it was no use to attempt to reach
home by walking. Availing myself of an omnibus from
Whitechapel Church to Farringdon Street, and another
from Farringdon Street onwards, I reached, in great
suffering, the neighbourhood of Soho Square, behind
which I lived. On going into the house I got some
hot water from the servant, and charging her very earnestly&mdash;literally
as a dying man&mdash;to accept eternal life as the
gift of <span class="smcap">God</span> through <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, I bathed my head and
lanced the finger, hoping to let out some of the poisoned
blood. The pain was very severe; I fainted away, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was for some time unconscious, so long that when I
came to myself I found that I had been carried to bed.</p>

<p>An uncle of mine who lived near at hand had come
in, and sent for his own medical man, an assistant surgeon
at the Westminster Hospital. I assured my uncle that
medical help would be of no service to me, and that I
did not wish to go to the expense involved. He, however,
quieted me on this score, saying that he had sent
for his own doctor, and that the bill would be charged to
himself. When the surgeon came and learned all the
particulars, he said, "Well, if you have been living moderately,
you may pull through; but if you have been going
in for beer and that sort of thing, there is no manner of
chance for you." I thought that if sober living was to
do anything, few could have a better chance, as little but
bread and water had been my diet for a good while past.
I told him I had lived abstemiously, and found that it
helped me in study. "But now," he said, "you must keep
up your strength, for it will be a pretty hard struggle."
And he ordered me a bottle of port wine every day, and
as many chops as I could consume. Again I smiled inwardly,
having no means for the purchase of such luxuries.
This difficulty, however, was also met by my kind uncle,
who sent me at once all that was needed.</p>

<p>I was much concerned, notwithstanding the agony
I suffered, that my dear parents should not be made
acquainted with my state. Thought and prayer had satisfied
me that I was not going to die, but that there was
indeed a work for me to do in China. If my dear parents
should come up and find me in that condition, I must
lose the opportunity of seeing how <span class="smcap">God</span> was going to work
for me, now that my money had almost come to an end.
So, after prayer for guidance, I obtained a promise from
my uncle and cousin not to write to my parents, but to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
leave me to communicate with them myself. I felt it was
a very distinct answer to prayer when they gave me
this promise, and I took care to defer all communication
with them myself until the crisis was past and the worst
of the attack over. At home they knew that I was working
hard for an examination, and did not wonder at my
silence.</p>

<p>Days and nights of suffering passed slowly by; but
at length, after several weeks, I was sufficiently restored to
leave my room; and then I learned that two men, though
not from the London Hospital, who had had dissection
wounds at the same time as myself, had both succumbed,
while I was spared in answer to prayer to work for <span class="smcap">God</span>
in China.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>STRENGTHENED BY FAITH</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONE day the doctor coming in found me on the sofa,
and was surprised to learn that with assistance I had
walked downstairs. "Now," he said, "the best thing you
can go is to get off to the country as soon as you feel
equal to the journey. You must rusticate until you have
recovered a fair amount of health and strength, for if you
begin your work too soon the consequences may still be
serious." When he had left, as I lay very exhausted on
the sofa, I just told the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> all about it, and that I was
refraining from making my circumstances known to those
who would delight to meet my need, in order that my faith
might be strengthened by receiving help from Himself in
answer to prayer alone. What was I to do? And I waited
for His answer.</div>

<p>It seemed to me as if He were directing my mind to
the conclusion to go again to the shipping office, and inquire
about the wages I had been unable to draw. I reminded
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that I could not afford to take a conveyance, and
that it did not seem at all likely that I should succeed in
getting the money, and asked whether this impulse was
not a mere clutching at a straw, some mental process of
my own, rather than His guidance and teaching. After
prayer, however, and renewed waiting upon <span class="smcap">God</span>, I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
confirmed in my belief that He Himself was teaching me
to go to the office.</p>

<p>The next question was, "How am I to go?" I had
had to seek help in coming downstairs, and the place was
at least two miles away. The assurance was brought
vividly home to me that whatever I asked of <span class="smcap">God</span> in the
name of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> would be done, that the <span class="smcap">Father</span> might
be glorified in the <span class="smcap">Son</span>; that what I had to do was to
seek strength for the long walk, to receive it by faith,
and to set out upon it. Unhesitatingly I told the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
that I was quite willing to take the walk if He would give
me the strength. I asked in the name of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> that
the strength might be immediately given; and sending
the servant up to my room for my hat and stick, I set
out, not to <i>attempt</i> to walk, but <span class="smcap">to walk</span> to Cheapside.</p>

<p>Although undoubtedly strengthened by faith, I never
took so much interest in shop windows as I did upon that
journey. At every second or third step I was glad to
lean a little against the plate glass, and take time to
examine the contents of the windows before passing on.
It needed a special effort of faith when I got to the
bottom of Farringdon Street to attempt the toilsome ascent
of Snow Hill: there was no Holborn Viaduct in those
days, and it had to be done. <span class="smcap">God</span> did wonderfully help
me, and in due time I reached Cheapside, turned into
the by-street in which the office was found, and sat down
much exhausted on the steps leading to the first floor,
which was my destination. I felt my position to be a
little peculiar&mdash;sitting there on the steps, so evidently
spent&mdash;and the gentlemen who rushed up and downstairs
looked at me with an inquiring gaze. After a
little rest, however, and a further season of prayer, I
succeeded in climbing the staircase, and to my comfort
found in the office the clerk with whom I had hitherto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
dealt in the matter. Seeing me looking pale and exhausted,
he kindly inquired as to my health, and I told
him that I had had a serious illness, and was ordered
to the country, but thought it well to call first, and make
further inquiry, lest there should have been any mistake
about the mate having run off to the gold diggings.
"Oh," he said, "I am so glad you have come, for it turns
out that it was an able seaman of the same name that ran
away. The mate is still on board; the ship has just
reached Gravesend, and will be up very soon. I shall
be glad to give you the half-pay up to date, for doubtless
it will reach his wife more safely through you. We all
know what temptations beset the men when they arrive at
home after a voyage."</p>

<p>Before, however, giving me the sum of money, he
insisted upon my coming inside and sharing his lunch. I
felt it was the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> indeed who was providing for me, and
accepted his offer with thankfulness. When I was refreshed
and rested, he gave me a sheet of paper to write a few lines
to the wife, telling her of the circumstances. On my way
back I procured in Cheapside a money order for the balance
due to her, and posted it; and returning home again, felt
myself now quite justified in taking an omnibus as far as it
would serve me.</p>

<p>Very much better the next morning, after seeing to
some little matters that I had to settle, I made my way to
the surgery of the doctor who had attended me, feeling
that, although my uncle was prepared to pay the bill, it
was right for me, now that I had some money in hand, to
ask for the account myself. The kind surgeon refused to
allow me, as a medical student, to pay anything for his
attendance: but he had supplied me with quinine, which
he allowed me to pay for to the extent of eight shillings.
When that was settled, I saw that the sum left was just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
sufficient to take me home; and to my mind the whole
thing seemed a wonderful interposition of <span class="smcap">God</span> on my
behalf.</p>

<p>I knew that the surgeon was sceptical, and told him that
I should very much like to speak to him freely, if I might
do so without offence; that I felt that under <span class="smcap">God</span> I owed
my life to his kind care, and wished very earnestly that he
himself might become a partaker of the same precious faith
that I possessed. So I told him my reason for being in
London, and about my circumstances, and why I had
declined the help of both my father and the officers of the
Society in connection with which it was probable that I
should go to China. I told him of the recent providential
dealings of <span class="smcap">God</span> with me, and how apparently hopeless
my position had been the day before, when he had ordered
me to go to the country, unless I would reveal my need,
which I had determined not to do. I described to him
the mental exercises I had gone through; but when I
added that I had actually got up from the sofa and walked
to Cheapside, he looked at me incredulously, and
"Impossible! Why, I left you lying there more like a
ghost than a man." And I had to assure him again and
again that, strengthened by faith, the walk had really been
taken. I told him also what money was left to me, and
what payments there had been to make, and showed him
that just sufficient remained to take me home to Yorkshire,
providing for needful refreshment by the way and the
omnibus journey at the end.</p>

<p>My kind friend was completely broken down, and said
with tears in his eyes, "I would give all the world for a
faith like yours." I, on the other hand, had the joy of
telling him that it was to be obtained without money and
without price. We never met again. When I came back
to town, restored to health and strength, I found that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had had a stroke, and left for the country; and I subsequently
learned that he never rallied. I was able to
gain no information as to his state of mind when taken
away; but I have always felt very thankful that I had the
opportunity, and embraced it, of bearing that testimony for
<span class="smcap">God</span>. I cannot but entertain the hope that the <span class="smcap">Master</span>
Himself was speaking to him through His dealings with
me, and that I shall meet him again in the Better Land.
It would be no small joy to be welcomed by him, when
my own service is over.</p>

<p>The next day found me in my dear parents' home. My
joy in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>'s help and deliverance was so great that
I was unable to keep it to myself, and before my return to
London my dear mother knew the secret of my life for
some time past. I need scarcely say that when I went up
again to town I was not allowed to live&mdash;as, indeed, I was
not fit to live&mdash;on the same economical lines as before
my illness. I needed more now, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> did provide.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>MIGHTY TO SAVE</h3>


<div class='cap'>RETURNING to London when sufficiently recovered
to resume my studies, the busy life of hospital and
lecture-hall was resumed; often relieved by happy Sundays
of fellowship with Christian friends, especially in London or
Tottenham. Opportunities for service are to be found in
every sphere, and mine was no exception. I shall only
mention one case now that gave me great encouragement
in seeking conversion even when it seemed apparently
hopeless.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> had given me the joy of winning souls before, but
not in surroundings of such special difficulty. With <span class="smcap">God</span>
all things are possible, and no conversion ever takes place
save by the almighty power of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>. The
great need, therefore, of every Christian worker is to <i>know</i>
<span class="smcap">God</span>. Indeed, this is the purpose for which He has given
us eternal life, as our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> Himself says, in the oft
misquoted verse, John xvii. 3: "This is [the object of]
life eternal, [not <i>to</i> know but] that they <i>might</i> know Thee
the only true <span class="smcap">God</span>, and <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, whom Thou hast
sent." I was now to prove the willingness of <span class="smcap">God</span> to
answer prayer for spiritual blessing under most unpromising
circumstances, and thus to gain an increased acquaintance
with the prayer-answering <span class="smcap">God</span> as One "mighty to save."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time before leaving for China, it became my duty
daily to dress the foot of a patient suffering from senile
gangrene. The disease commenced, as usual, insidiously,
and the patient had little idea that he was a doomed man,
and probably had not long to live. I was not the first to
attend to him, but when the case was transferred to me, I
naturally became very anxious about his soul. The family
with whom he lived were Christians, and from them I
learned that he was an avowed atheist, and very antagonistic
to anything religious. They had, without asking his consent,
invited a Scripture reader to visit him, but in great passion
he had ordered him from the room. The vicar of the district
had also called, hoping to help him; but he had spit in his
face, and refused to allow him to speak to him. His
passionate temper was described to me as very violent,
and altogether the case seemed to be as hopeless as could
well be imagined.</p>

<p>Upon first commencing to attend him I prayed much
about it; but for two or three days said nothing to him
of a religious nature. By special care in dressing his
diseased limb I was able considerably to lessen his sufferings,
and he soon began to manifest grateful appreciation
of my services. One day, with a trembling heart, I took
advantage of his warm acknowledgments to tell him what
was the spring of my action, and to speak of his own
solemn position and need of <span class="smcap">God</span>'s mercy through <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.
It was evidently only by a powerful effort of self-restraint
that he kept his lips closed. He turned over in bed
with his back to me, and uttered no word.</p>

<p>I could not get the poor man out of my mind, and
very often through each day I pleaded with <span class="smcap">God</span>, by His
<span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, to save him ere He took him hence. After dressing
the wound and relieving his pain, I never failed to say a
few words to him, which I hoped the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> would bless.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
He always turned his back to me, looking annoyed, but
never spoke a word in reply.</p>

<p>After continuing this for some time, my heart sank. It
seemed to me that I was not only doing no good, but perhaps
really hardening him and increasing his guilt. One day,
after dressing his limb and washing my hands, instead of
returning to the bedside to speak to him, I went to the door,
and stood hesitating for a few moments with the thought in
my mind, "Ephraim is joined to his idols; let him alone."
I looked at the man and saw his surprise, as it was the first
time since speaking to him that I had attempted to leave
without going up to his bedside to say a few words for my
<span class="smcap">Master</span>. I could bear it no longer. Bursting into tears,
I crossed the room and said, "My friend, whether you
will hear or whether you will forbear, I <i>must</i> deliver <i>my</i>
soul," and went on to speak very earnestly to him, telling
him with many tears how much I wished that he would let
me pray with him. To my unspeakable joy he did not
turn away, but replied, "If it will be a relief to you, do."
I need scarcely say that I fell on my knees and poured
out my whole soul to <span class="smcap">God</span> on his behalf. I believe the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> then and there wrought a change in his soul.</p>

<p>He was never afterwards unwilling to be spoken to and
prayed with, and within a few days he definitely accepted
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> as his <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>. Oh the joy it was to me to see
that dear man rejoicing in hope of the glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>!
He told me that for forty years he had never darkened the
door of church or chapel, and that then&mdash;forty years ago&mdash;he
had only entered a place of worship to be married,
and could not be persuaded to go inside when his wife was
buried. Now, thank <span class="smcap">God</span>, his sin-stained soul, I had every
reason to believe, was washed, was sanctified, was justified,
in the Name of the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span> and in the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>
of our <span class="smcap">God</span>. Oftentimes, when in my early work in China<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
circumstances rendered me almost hopeless of success, I
have thought of this man's conversion, and have been
encouraged to persevere in speaking the Word, whether
men would hear or whether they would forbear.</p>

<p>The now happy sufferer lived for some time after this
change, and was never tired of bearing testimony to the
grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>. Though his condition was most distressing,
the alteration in his character and behaviour made the
previously painful duty of attending him one of real pleasure.
I have often thought since, in connection with this
case and the work of <span class="smcap">God</span> generally, of the words, "He
that goeth forth <i>weeping</i>, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless
come again rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him."
Perhaps if there were more of that intense distress for
souls that leads to tears, we should more frequently see the
results we desire. Sometimes it may be that while we are
complaining of the hardness of the hearts of those we
are seeking to benefit, the hardness of our own hearts,
and our own feeble apprehension of the solemn reality of
eternal things, may be the true cause of our want of
success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>VOYAGE TO CHINA</h3>


<div class='cap'>SOON after this the time so long looked forward to
arrived&mdash;the time that I was to leave England
for China. After being set apart with many prayers
for the ministry of <span class="smcap">God</span>'s Word among the heathen
Chinese I left London for Liverpool; and on the 19th
of September 1853 a little service was held in the stern
cabin of the <i>Dumfries</i>, which had been secured for me by
the Committee of the Chinese Evangelisation Society, under
whose auspices I was going to China.</div>

<p>My beloved, now sainted, mother had come to see me
off from Liverpool. Never shall I forget that day, nor
how she went with me into the little cabin that was to
be my home for nearly six long months. With a mother's
loving hand she smoothed the little bed. She sat by my
side, and joined me in the last hymn that we should sing
together before the long parting. We knelt down, and
she prayed&mdash;the last mother's prayer I was to hear before
starting for China. Then notice was given that we must
separate, and we had to say good-bye, never expecting to
meet on earth again.</p>

<p>For my sake she restrained her feelings as much as
possible. We parted; and she went on shore, giving me
her blessing; I stood alone on deck, and she followed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
ship as we moved towards the dock gates. As we passed
through the gates, and the separation really commenced,
I shall never forget the cry of anguish wrung from that
mother's heart. It went through me like a knife. I never
knew so fully, until then, what <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>so</i> loved the world
meant. And I am quite sure that my precious mother
learned more of the love of <span class="smcap">God</span> to the perishing in that
hour than in all her life before.</p>

<p>Oh, how it must grieve the heart of <span class="smcap">God</span> when He sees
His children indifferent to the needs of that wide world for
which His beloved, His only begotten <span class="smcap">Son</span> died!</p>

<div class='poem2'>
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;<br />
Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;<br />
So shall the <span class="smcap">King</span> desire thy beauty:<br />
For He is thy <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and worship thou Him.<br />
</div>

<p>Praise <span class="smcap">God</span>, the number is increasing who are finding out
the exceeding joys, the wondrous revelations of His mercies,
vouchsafed to those who follow Him, and emptying themselves,
leave all in obedience to His great commission.</p>

<p>It was on 19th September 1853 that the <i>Dumfries</i>
sailed for China; and not until 1st March, in the spring
of the following year, did I arrive in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Our voyage had a rough beginning, but many had
promised to remember us in constant prayer. No small
comfort was this; for we had scarcely left the Mersey when
a violent equinoctial gale caught us, and for twelve days we
were beating backwards and forwards in the Irish Channel,
unable to get out to sea. The gale steadily increased, and
after almost a week we lay to for a time; but drifting on
a lee coast, we were compelled again to make sail, and
endeavoured to beat on to windward. The utmost efforts
of the captain and crew, however, were unavailing; and
Sunday night, 25th September, found us drifting into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Carnarvon Bay, each tack becoming shorter, until at last
we were within a stone's-throw of the rocks. About this
time, as the ship, which had refused to stay, was put round
in the other direction, the Christian captain said to me,
"We cannot live half an hour now: what of your call to
labour for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in China?" I had previously passed
through a time of much conflict, but that was over, and it
was a great joy to feel and to tell him that I would not for
any consideration be in any other position; that I strongly
expected to reach China; but that, if otherwise, at any rate
the Master would say it was well that I was found seeking
to obey His command.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes after wearing ship the captain
walked, up to the compass, and said to me, "The wind has
freed two points; we shall be able to beat out of the bay."
And so we did. The bowsprit was sprung and the vessel
seriously strained; but in a few days we got out to sea, and
the necessary repairs were so thoroughly effected on board
that our journey to China was in due time satisfactorily
accomplished.</p>

<p>One thing was a great trouble to me that night. I was
a very young believer, and had not sufficient faith in <span class="smcap">God</span>
to see Him in and through the use of means. I had felt
it a duty to comply with the earnest wish of my beloved
and honoured mother, and for her sake to procure a
swimming-belt. But in my own soul I felt as if I could
not simply trust in <span class="smcap">God</span> while I had this swimming-belt;
and my heart had no rest until on that night, after all
hope of being saved was gone, I had given it away. Then
I had perfect peace; and, strange to say, put several light
things together, likely to float at the time we struck, without
any thought of inconsistency or scruple. Ever since, I
have seen clearly the mistake I made&mdash;a mistake that is
very common in these days, when erroneous teaching on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
faith-healing does much harm, misleading some as to the
purposes of <span class="smcap">God</span>, shaking the faith of others, and distressing
the minds of many. The use of means ought not to
lessen our faith in <span class="smcap">God</span>; and our faith in <span class="smcap">God</span> ought not
to hinder our using whatever means He has given us for the
accomplishment of His own purposes.</p>

<p>For years after this I always took a swimming-belt with
me, and never had any trouble about it; for after the
storm was over, the question was settled for me, through
the prayerful study of the Scriptures. <span class="smcap">God</span> gave me then
to see my mistake, probably to deliver me from a great deal
of trouble on similar questions now so constantly raised.
When in medical or surgical charge of any case, I have
never thought of neglecting to ask <span class="smcap">God</span>'s guidance and
blessing in the use of appropriate means, nor yet of
omitting to give Him thanks for answered prayer and
restored health. But to me it would appear as presumptuous
and wrong to neglect the use of those measures
which He Himself has put within our reach, as to neglect
to take daily food, and suppose that life and health might
be maintained by prayer alone.</p>

<p>The voyage was a very tedious one. We lost a good
deal of time on the equator from calms; and when we
finally reached the Eastern Archipelago, were again detained
from the same cause. Usually a breeze would spring up
soon after sunset, and last until about dawn. The utmost
use was made of it, but during the day we lay still with
flapping sails, often drifting back and losing a good deal of
the advantage we had gained during the night.</p>

<p>This happened notably on one occasion, when we were
in dangerous proximity to the north of New Guinea. Saturday
night had brought us to a point some thirty miles off the
land; but during the Sunday morning service, which was
held on deck, I could not fail to notice that the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
looked troubled, and frequently went over to the side of
the ship. When the service was ended, I learnt from him
the cause&mdash;a four-knot current was carrying us rapidly towards
some sunken reefs, and we were already so near that
it seemed improbable that we should get through the afternoon
in safety. After dinner the long-boat was put out,
and all hands endeavoured, without success, to turn the
ship's head from the shore. As we drifted nearer we
could plainly see the natives rushing about the sands
and lighting fires every here and there. The captain's
horn-book informed him that these people were cannibals,
so that our position was not a little alarming.</p>

<p>After standing together on the deck for some time in
silence, the captain said to me, "Well, we have done everything
that can be done; we can only await the result." A
thought occurred to me, and I replied, "No, there is one
thing we have not done yet." "What is it?" he queried.
"Four of us on board are Christians," I answered (the
Swedish carpenter and our coloured steward, with the
captain and myself); "let us each retire to his own cabin,
and in agreed prayer ask the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to give us immediately
a breeze. He can as easily send it now as at sunset."</p>

<p>The captain complied with this proposal. I went and
spoke to the other two men, and after prayer with the carpenter
we all four retired to wait upon <span class="smcap">God</span>. I had a good
but very brief season in prayer, and then felt so satisfied that
our request was granted that I could not continue asking,
and very soon went up again on deck. The first officer,
a godless man, was in charge. I went over and asked him
to let down the clews or corners of the mainsail, which
had been drawn up in order to lessen the useless flapping
of the sail against the rigging. He answered, "What would
be the good of that?" I told him we had been asking
a wind from <span class="smcap">God</span>, that it was coming immediately, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were so near the reef by this time that there was not a
minute to lose. With a look of incredulity and contempt,
he said with an oath that he would rather see a wind than
hear of it! But while he was speaking I watched his eye,
and followed it up to the royal (the topmost sail), and
there, sure enough, the corner of the sail was beginning
to tremble in the coming breeze. "Don't you see the
wind is coming? Look at the royal!" I exclaimed. "No,
it is only a cat's-paw," he rejoined (a mere puff of wind).
"Cat's-paw or not," I cried, "pray let down the mainsail,
and let us have the benefit!"</p>

<p>This he was not slow to do. In another minute the
heavy tread of the men on the deck brought up the
captain from his cabin to see what was the matter; and he
saw that the breeze had indeed come. In a few minutes
we were ploughing our way at six or seven knots an hour
through the water, and the multitude of naked savages
whom we had seen on the beach had no wreckage that
night. We were soon out of danger; and though the
wind was sometimes unsteady, we did not altogether lose
it until after passing the Pelew Islands.</p>

<p>Thus <span class="smcap">God</span> encouraged me, ere landing on China's
shores, to bring every variety of need to Him in prayer,
and <i>to expect that He would honour the Name</i> of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and give the help which each emergency required.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>EARLY MISSIONARY EXPERIENCES</h3>


<div class='cap'>ON landing in Shanghai on 1st March 1854, I found
myself surrounded with difficulties that were wholly
unexpected. A band of rebels, known as the "Red Turbans,"
had taken possession of the native city, against which was
encamped an Imperial army of from forty to fifty thousand
men, who were a much greater source of discomfort and
danger to the little European community than were the
rebels themselves. Upon landing, I was told that to live
outside the Settlement was impossible, while within the
foreign concession apartments were scarcely obtainable at
any price. The dollar, now worth about three shillings,
had risen to a value of eight-and-ninepence, and the
prospect for one with only a small income of English
money was dark indeed. However, I had three letters of
introduction, and counted on counsel and help, especially
from one of those to whom I had been commended, whose
friends I well knew and highly valued. Of course I sought
him out at once, but only to learn that he had been buried
a month or two before, having died from fever during the
time of my voyage.</div>

<p>Saddened by these tidings, I inquired for a missionary
to whom another of my letters of introduction was
addressed; but a further disappointment awaited me&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had left for America. The third letter remained; but as
it had been given by a comparative stranger, I had
expected less from it than from the other two. It proved,
however, to be <span class="smcap">God</span>'s channel of help. The Rev. Dr.
Medhurst, of the London Mission, to whom it was
addressed, introduced me to Dr. Lockhart, who kindly
allowed me to live with him for six months. Dr.
Medhurst procured my first Chinese teacher; and he, Dr.
Edkins, and the late Mr. Alexander Wylie gave me
considerable help with the language.</p>

<p>Those were indeed troublous times, and times of
danger. Coming out of the city one day with Mr. Wylie,
he entered into conversation with two coolies, while we
waited a little while at the East Gate for a companion who
was behind us. Before our companion came up an attack
upon the city from the batteries on the opposite side of the
river commenced, which caused us to hurry away to a place
of less danger, the whiz of the balls being unpleasantly near.
The coolies, unfortunately, stayed too long, and were
wounded. On reaching the Settlement we stopped a
few minutes to make a purchase, and then proceeded at
once to the London Mission compound, where, at the
door of the hospital, we found the two poor coolies
with whom Mr. Wylie had conversed, their four ankles
terribly shattered by a cannon ball. The poor fellows
declined amputation, and both died. We felt how narrow
had been our escape.</p>

<p>At another time, early in the morning, I had joined one
of the missionaries on his verandah to watch the battle
proceeding, at a distance of perhaps three-quarters of a
mile, when suddenly a spent ball passed between us and
buried itself in the verandah wall. Another day my friend
Mr. Wylie left a book on the table after luncheon, and
returning for it about five minutes later, found the arm of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the chair on which he had been sitting shot clean away.
But in the midst of these and many other dangers <span class="smcap">God</span>
protected us.</p>

<p>After six months' stay with Dr. Lockhart, I rented a
native house outside the Settlement, and commenced a
little missionary work amongst my Chinese neighbours,
which for a few months continued practicable. When the
French joined the Imperialists in attacking the city, the
position of my house became so dangerous that during
the last few weeks, in consequence of nightly recurring
skirmishes, I gave up attempting to sleep except in the
daytime. One night a fire appeared very near, and I
climbed up to a little observatory I had arranged on the
roof of the house, to see whether it was necessary to attempt
escape. While there a ball struck the ridge of the roof on
the opposite side of the quadrangle, showering pieces of
broken tile all around me, while the ball itself rolled down
into the court below. It weighed four or five pounds;
and had it come a few inches higher, would probably have
spent its force on me instead of on the building. My dear
mother kept the ball for many years. Shortly after this I had
to abandon the house and return to the Foreign Settlement&mdash;a
step that was taken none too soon, for before the last of my
belongings were removed, the house was burnt to the ground.</p>

<p>Of the trials of this early period it is scarcely possible
to convey any adequate idea. To one of a sensitive
nature, the horrors, atrocities, and misery connected with
war were a terrible ordeal. The embarrassment also of
the times was considerable. With an income of only
eighty pounds a year, I was compelled, upon moving into
the Settlement, to give one hundred and twenty for rent,
and sublet half the house; and though the Committee of
the Chinese Evangelisation Society increased my income
when, after the arrival of Dr. Parker, they learned more of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
our circumstances, many painful experiences had necessarily
been passed through. Few can realise how distressing to
so young and untried a worker these difficulties seemed, or
the intense loneliness of the position of a pioneer who could
not even hint at many of his circumstances, as to do so
would have been a tacit appeal for help.</p>

<p>The great enemy is always ready with his oft-repeated
suggestion, "All these things are against me." But oh,
how false the word! The cold, and even the hunger, the
watchings and sleeplessness of nights of danger, and the
feeling at times of utter isolation and helplessness, were
well and wisely chosen, and tenderly and lovingly meted
out. What circumstances could have rendered the Word
of <span class="smcap">God</span> more sweet, the presence of <span class="smcap">God</span> more real, the
help of <span class="smcap">God</span> more precious? They were times, indeed, of
emptying and humbling, but were experiences that made
not ashamed, and that strengthened purpose to go forward
as <span class="smcap">God</span> might direct, with His <i>proved</i> promise, "I will not
fail thee, nor forsake thee." One can see, even now, that
as for <span class="smcap">God</span>, His way is perfect, and yet can rejoice that
the missionary path of to-day is comparatively a smooth and
an easy one.</p>

<p>Journeying inland was contrary to treaty arrangements,
and attended with much difficulty, especially for some time
after the battle of Muddy Flat, in which an Anglo-American
contingent of about three hundred marines and seamen,
with a volunteer corps of less than a hundred residents,
attacked the Imperial camp, and drove away from thirty to
fifty thousand Chinese soldiers, the range of our shot and
shell making the native artillery useless. Still, in the
autumn of 1854 a journey of perhaps a week's duration
was safely accomplished with Dr. Edkins, who of course
did the speaking and preaching, while I was able to help
in the distribution of books.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>FIRST EVANGELISTIC EFFORTS</h3>


<div class='cap'>A JOURNEY taken in the spring of 1855 with the
Rev. J. S. Burden of the Church Missionary Society
(now the Bishop of Victoria, Hong-kong) was attended with
some serious dangers.</div>

<p>In the great mouth of the river Yang-tse, distant some
thirty miles to the north of Shanghai, lies the group of
islands of which Ts'ung-ming and Hai-men are the largest
and most important; and farther up the river, where
the estuary narrows away from the sea, is situated the
influential city of T'ung-chau, close to Lang-shan, or the
Wolf Mountains, famous as a resort for pilgrim devotees.
We spent some time in evangelising on those islands, and
then proceeded to Lang-shan, where we preached and gave
books to thousands of the devotees who were attending an
idolatrous festival. From thence we went on to T'ung-chau,
and of our painful experiences there the following
journal will tell:&mdash;</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>Thursday, April 26th, 1855.</i><br />
</div>

<p>After breakfast we commended ourselves to the care of
our Heavenly <span class="smcap">Father</span>, and sought His Blessing before proceeding
to this great city. The day was dull and wet. We
felt persuaded that Satan would not allow us to assail his
kingdom, as we were attempting to do, without raising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
serious opposition; but we were also fully assured that it
was the will of <span class="smcap">God</span> that we should preach <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in this
city, and distribute the Word of Truth among its people.
We were sorry that we had but few books left for such an
important place: the result, however, proved that this also
was providential.</p>

<p>Our native teachers did their best to persuade us not to
go into the city; but we determined that, by <span class="smcap">God's</span> help,
nothing should hinder us. We directed them, however, to
remain in one of the boats; and if we did not return, to
learn whatever they could respecting our fate, and make all
possible haste to Shanghai with the information. We also
arranged that the other boat should wait for us, even if we
could not get back that night, so that we might not be
detained for want of a boat in case of returning later. We
then put our books into two bags, and with a servant who
always accompanied us on these occasions, set off for the
city, distant about seven miles. Walking was out of the
question, from the state of the roads, so we availed ourselves
of wheel-barrows, the only conveyance to be had in
these parts. A wheel-barrow is cheaper than a sedan, only
requiring one coolie; but is by no means an agreeable
conveyance on rough, dirty roads.</p>

<p>We had not gone far before the servant requested
permission to go back, as he was thoroughly frightened by
reports concerning the native soldiery. Of course we at
once consented, not wishing to involve another in trouble,
and determined to carry the books ourselves, and look for
physical as well as spiritual strength to Him who had
promised to supply all our need.</p>

<p>At this point a respectable man came up, and earnestly
warned us against proceeding, saying that if we did we
should find to our sorrow what the T'ung-chau militia were
like. We thanked him for his kindly counsel, but could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
not act upon it, as our hearts were fixed, whether it were
to bonds, imprisonment, and death, or whether to distribute
our Scriptures and tracts in safety, and return unhurt, we
knew not; but we were determined, by the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
not to leave T'ung-chau any longer without the Gospel, nor
its teeming thousands to die in uncared-for ignorance of
the Way of life.</p>

<p>After this my wheel-barrow man would proceed no
farther, and I had to seek another, who was fortunately not
difficult to find. As we went on, the ride in the mud and
rain was anything but agreeable, and we could not help
feeling the danger of our position, although wavering not
for a moment. At intervals we encouraged one another
with promises from the Scripture and verses of hymns.
That verse&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The perils of the sea, the perils of the land,<br />
Should not dishearten thee: thy <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is nigh at hand.<br />
But should thy courage fail, when tried and sore oppressed,<br />
His promise shall avail, and set thy soul at rest."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>seemed particularly appropriate to our circumstances, and
was very comforting to me.</div>

<p>On our way we passed through one small town of about
a thousand inhabitants; and here, in the Mandarin dialect,
I preached <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> to a good number of people. Never was
I so happy in speaking of the love of <span class="smcap">God</span> and the atonement
of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>. My own soul was richly blessed,
and filled with joy and peace; and I was able to speak
with unusual freedom and ease. And how rejoiced I was
when, afterwards, I heard one of our hearers repeating to
the newcomers, in his own local dialect, the truths upon
which I had been dwelling! Oh, how thankful I felt to
hear a Chinaman, of his own accord, telling his fellow-countrymen
that <span class="smcap">God</span> loved them; that they were sinners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
but that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> died instead of them, and paid the penalty
of their guilt. That one moment repaid me for all the
trials we had passed through; and I felt that if the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
should grant <span class="smcap">His Holy Spirit</span> to change the heart of that
man, we had not come in vain.</p>

<p>We distributed a few Testaments and tracts, for the
people were able to read, and we could not leave them
without the Gospel. It was well that we did so, for when
we reached T'ung-chau we found we had quite as many left
as we had strength to carry.</p>

<p>Nearing the end of our journey, as we approached the
western suburb of the city, the prayer of the early
Christians, when persecution was commencing, came to my
mind: "And now, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, behold their threatenings, and
grant unto Thy servants that with all boldness they may
speak Thy Word." In this petition we most heartily
united. Before entering the suburb we laid our plans, so
as to act in concert, and told our wheel-barrow men
where to await us, that they might not be involved in
any trouble on our account. Then looking up to our
Heavenly <span class="smcap">Father</span>, we committed ourselves to His keeping,
took our books, and set on for the city.</p>

<p>For some distance we walked along the principal street
of the suburb leading to the West Gate unmolested, and
were amused at the unusual title of <i>Heh-kwei-tsi</i> (black
devils) which was applied to us. We wondered about it
at the time, but afterwards found that it was our clothes,
and not our skin, that gave rise to it. As we passed
several of the soldiers, I remarked to Mr. Burdon that
these were the men we had heard so much about, and that
they seemed willing to receive us quietly enough. Long
before we reached the gate, however, a tall powerful man,
made tenfold fiercer by partial intoxication, let us know
that all the militia were not so peaceably inclined, by seizing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Mr. Burdon by the shoulders. My companion endeavoured
to shake him off. I turned to see what was the matter,
and at once we were surrounded by a dozen or more brutal
men, who hurried us on to the city at a fearful pace.</p>

<p>My bag now began to feel very heavy, and I could not
change hands to relieve myself. I was soon in a profuse
perspiration, and was scarcely able to keep pace with them.
We demanded to be taken before the chief magistrate, but
were told that they knew where to take us, and what to do
with such persons as we were, with the most insulting
epithets. The man who first seized Mr. Burdon soon afterwards
left him for me, and became my principal tormentor;
for I was neither so tall nor so strong as my friend, and
was therefore less able to resist him. He all but knocked
me down again and again, seized me by the hair, took hold
of my collar so as to almost choke me, and grasped my
arms and shoulders, making them black and blue. Had
this treatment continued much longer, I must have fainted.
All but exhausted, how refreshing was the remembrance of
a verse quoted by my dear mother in one of my last home
letters&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"We speak of the realms of the blest,<br />
That country so bright and so fair,<br />
And oft are its glories confessed;<br />
But what must it be to be there!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>To be absent from the body! to be present with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>!
to be free from sin! And this is the end of the worst that
man's malice can ever bring upon us.</div>

<p>As we were walking along Mr. Burdon tried to give
away a few books that he was carrying, not knowing
whether we might have another opportunity of doing so;
but the fearful rage of the soldier, and the way he insisted
on manacles being brought, which fortunately were not at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hand, convinced us that in our present position we could
do no good in attempting book-distribution. There was
nothing to be done but quietly to submit, and go along
with our captors.</p>

<p>Once or twice a quarrel arose as to how we should be
dealt with; the more mild of our conductors saying that
we ought to be taken to the magistrate's office, but others
wishing to kill us at once without appeal to any authority.
Our minds were kept in perfect peace; and when thrown
together on one of these occasions, we reminded each other
that the Apostles rejoiced that they were counted <i>worthy</i>
to suffer in the cause of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. Having succeeded in
getting my hand into my pocket, I produced a Chinese
card (if the large red paper, bearing one's name, may be so
called), and after this was treated with more respect. I
demanded it should be given to the chief official of the
place, and that we should be led to his office. Before this
we had been unable, say what we would, to persuade them that
we were foreigners, although we were both in English attire.</p>

<p>Oh the long weary streets that we were dragged through!
I thought they would never end; and seldom have I felt
more thankful than when we stopped at a place where we
were told a mandarin resided. Quite exhausted, bathed in
perspiration, and with my tongue cleaving to the roof of
my mouth, I leaned against the wall, and saw that Mr.
Burdon was in much the same condition. I requested
them to bring us chairs, but they told us to wait; and
when I begged them to give us some tea, received only
the same answer. Round the doorway a large crowd
had gathered; and Mr. Burdon, collecting his remaining
strength, preached <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> to them. Our cards and
books had been taken in to the mandarin, but he proved to
be one of low rank, and after keeping us waiting for some
time he referred us to his superiors in office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon hearing this, and finding that it was their purpose
to turn us out again into the crowded streets, we positively
refused to move a single step, and insisted on chairs being
brought. After some demur this was done; we seated
ourselves in them, and were carried on. On the road we
felt so glad of the rest which the chairs afforded us, and so
thankful at having been able to preach <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> in spite of
Satan's malice, that our joy was depicted on our countenances;
and as we passed along we heard some say that we
did not look like bad men, while others seemed to pity us.
When we arrived at the magistrate's office, I wondered
where we were being taken; for though we passed through
some great gates that looked like those of the city wall, we
were still evidently within the city. A second pair of
gates suggested the idea that it was a prison into which we
were being carried; but when we came in sight of a large
tablet, with the inscription "<i>Ming ch&iuml; fu mu</i>" (the father and
mother of the people), we felt that we had been conveyed
to the right place; this being the title assumed by the
mandarins.</p>

<p>Our cards were again sent in, and after a short delay we
were taken into the presence of Ch'en Ta Lao-ie (the Great
Venerable Father Ch'en), who, as it proved, had formerly
been Tao-tai of Shanghai, and consequently knew the
importance of treating foreigners with courtesy. Coming
before him, some of the people fell on their knees and
bowed down to the ground, and my conductor motioned
for me to do the same, but without success. This
mandarin, who seemed to be the highest authority of
T'ung-chau, and wore an opaque blue button on his cap,
came out to meet us, and treated us with every possible
token of respect. He took us to an inner apartment, a
more private room, but was followed by a large number
of writers, runners, and other semi-officials. I related the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
object of our visit, and begged permission to give him copies
of our books and tracts, for which he thanked me. As I
handed him a copy of the New Testament with part of
the Old (from Genesis to Ruth) and some tracts, I tried
to explain a little about them, and also to give him a brief
summary of our teachings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He listened very attentively,
as of course did all the others present. He then ordered
some refreshments to be brought in, which were very
welcome, and himself partook of them with us.</p>

<p>After a long stay, we asked permission to see something
of the city, and to distribute the books we had brought,
before our return. To this he kindly consented. We then
mentioned that we had been most disrespectfully treated as
we came in, but that we did not attach much importance
to the fact, being aware that the soldiers knew no better.
Not desiring, however, to have such an experience repeated,
we requested him to give orders that we were not to be
further molested. This also he promised to do, and with
every possible token of respect accompanied us to the door
of his official residence, sending several runners to see that
we were respectfully treated. We distributed our books
well and quickly, and left the city quite in state. It was
amusing to us to see the way in which the runners made
use of their tails. When the street was blocked by the
crowd, they turned them into whips, and laid them about
the people's shoulders to right and left!</p>

<p>We had a little trouble in finding our wheel-barrows;
but eventually succeeding, we paid off the chair coolies,
mounted our humble vehicles, and returned to the river,
accompanied for fully half the distance by an attendant
from the magistrate's office. Early in the evening we got
back to the boats in safety, sincerely thankful to our
Heavenly <span class="smcap">Father</span> for His gracious protection and aid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>WITH THE REV. WILLIAM BURNS</h3>


<div class='cap'>AFTER the retaking of Shanghai by the Imperialists,
in February 1855, I was enabled to rent a house
within the walls of the native city, and gladly availed
myself of this opportunity to reside amidst the crowded
population left to inhabit the ruins that had survived the
war. Here I made my headquarters, though often absent
on more or less prolonged itinerations.</div>

<p>At the suggestion of the Rev. Dr. Medhurst, the veteran
leader of the London Mission, I was led at about this period
to adopt the native costume in preference to foreign dress,
to facilitate travel and residence inland. The Chinese had
permitted a foreign firm to build a silk factory some
distance inland, with the proviso that the style of building
must be purely Chinese, and that there should be
nothing external to suggest that it was foreign. Much
benefit was found to result from this change of costume;
and I, and most of those associated with me, have continued
to use native dress.</p>

<p>The T'ai-p'ing rebellion, commenced in 1851, had by
this time reached the height of its ephemeral success. The
great city of Nan-king had fallen before the invading host;
and there, within two hundred miles of Shanghai, the rebels
had established their headquarters, and proceeded to fortify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
themselves for further conquests. During the summer of
1855 various attempts were made to visit the leaders of
the movement, in order to bring to bear some decidedly
Christian influence upon them; but so little success was
met with, that these efforts were abandoned.</p>

<p>I, amongst others, had sought to reach Nan-king; but
finding it impossible to do so, turned my attention again to
evangelistic work on the island of Ts'ung-ming. After
some time I was enabled so far to overcome the prejudice
and fears of the people as to rent a little house and settle
down in their midst. This was a great joy and encouragement
to me; but before many weeks were over complaints
were made by the local authorities to the British Consul,
who compelled me to retire; though the French Consul
had himself secured to the Romish missionaries a property
within three or four miles of the house I had to vacate.
Sorely tried and disappointed by this unexpected hindrance,
I reluctantly returned to Shanghai, little dreaming of the
blessing that <span class="smcap">God</span> had in store for me there.</p>

<p>A few months previously the Rev. William Burns, of
the English Presbyterian Mission, had arrived in that port
on his return journey from home; and before proceeding
to his former sphere of service in the southern province
of <span class="smcap">Fu-kien</span>, he had endeavoured, like myself, without
success, to visit the T'ai-p'ing rebels at Nan-king. Failing
in this attempt, he made his headquarters in Shanghai for
a season, devoting himself to the evangelisation of the surrounding
populous regions. Thus in the autumn of the
year I was providentially led into association with this
beloved and honoured servant of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>We journeyed together, evangelising cities and towns in
southern <span class="smcap">Kiang-su</span> and north <span class="smcap">Cheh-kiang</span>, living in our
boats, and following the course of the canals and rivers
which here spread like a network over the whole face of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the rich and fertile country. Mr. Burns at that time was
wearing English dress; but saw that while I was the
younger and in every way less experienced, I had the quiet
hearers, while he was followed by the rude boys, and by
the curious but careless; that I was invited to the homes
of the people, while he received an apology that the crowd
that would follow precluded his being invited. After some
weeks of observation he also adopted the native dress, and
enjoyed the increased facilities which it gave.</p>

<p>Those happy months were an unspeakable joy and
privilege to me. His love for the Word was delightful,
and his holy, reverential life and constant communings
with <span class="smcap">God</span> made fellowship with him satisfying to the deep
cravings of my heart. His accounts of revival work and
of persecutions in Canada, and Dublin, and in Southern
China were most instructive, as well as interesting; for
with true spiritual insight he often pointed out <span class="smcap">God</span>'s purposes
in trial in a way that made all life assume quite a
new aspect and value. His views especially about evangelism
as the great work of the Church, and the order of
lay evangelists as a lost order that Scripture required to be
restored, were seed-thoughts which were to prove fruitful in
the subsequent organisation of the China Inland Mission.</p>

<p>Externally, however, our path was not always a smooth
one; but when permitted to stay for any length of time in
town or city, the opportunity was well utilised. We were
in the habit of leaving our boats, after prayer for blessing,
at about nine o'clock in the morning, with a light bamboo
stool in hand. Selecting a suitable station, one would
mount the stool and speak for twenty minutes, while the
other was pleading for blessing; and then changing places,
the voice of the first speaker had a rest. After an hour or
two thus occupied, we would move on to another point at
some distance from the first, and speak again. Usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
about midday we returned to our boats for dinner, fellowship,
and prayer, and then resumed our out-door work
until dusk. After tea and further rest, we would go with
our native helpers to some tea-shop, where several hours
might be spent in free conversation with the people. Not
infrequently before leaving a town we had good reason to
believe that much truth had been grasped; and we placed
many Scriptures and books in the hands of those interested.
The following letter was written by Mr. Burns to his
mother at home in Scotland about this time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>
"<span class="smcap">Twenty-five miles from Shanghai</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;"><i>January 26th, 1856</i>.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Taking advantage of a rainy day which confines me to
my boat, I pen a few lines, in addition to a letter to Dundee,
containing particulars which I need not repeat. It is now
forty-one days since I left Shanghai on this last occasion.
A young English missionary, Mr. Taylor, of the Chinese
Evangelisation Society, has been my companion during these
weeks&mdash;he in his boat, and I in mine&mdash;and we have experienced
much mercy, and on some occasions considerable
assistance in our work.</p>

<p>"I must once more tell the story I have had to tell
already more than once&mdash;how four weeks ago, on December
29th, I put on the Chinese dress, which I am now wearing.
Mr. Taylor had made this change a few months before, and
I found that he was, in consequence, so much less incommoded
in preaching, etc., by the crowd, that I concluded it
was my duty to follow his example. We were at that time
more than double the distance from Shanghai that we are
now, and would still have been at as great a distance had
we not met at one place with a band of lawless people, who
demanded money and threatened to break our boats if their
demands were refused. The boatmen were very much
alarmed, and insisted on returning to some place nearer
home. These people had previously broken in, violently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a part of Mr. Taylor's boat, because their unreasonable
demand for books was not complied with.</p>

<p>"We have a large, very large, field of labour in this
region, though it might be difficult in the meantime for one
to establish himself in any particular place; the people
listen with attention, but we need the Power from on High
to convince and convert. Is there any spirit of prayer on
our behalf among <span class="smcap">God</span>'s people in Kilsyth? or is there any
effort to seek this spirit? How great the need is, and how
great the arguments and motives for prayer in this case.
The harvest here is indeed great, and the labourers are few,
and imperfectly fitted without much grace for such a work.
And yet grace can make the few and feeble instruments the
means of accomplishing great things&mdash;things greater than
we can even conceive."</p></div>

<p>The incident referred to in this letter, which led to our
return to Shanghai more speedily than we had at first
intended, took place on the northern border of <span class="smcap">Cheh-kiang</span>.
We had reached a busy market town known by
the name of Wu-chen, or Black Town, the inhabitants of
which, we had been told, were the wildest and most lawless
people in that part of the country. Such indeed we found
them to be: the town was a refuge for salt smugglers and
other bad characters. The following extracts are taken
from my journal, written at the time:&mdash;</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>January 8th, 1856.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Commenced our work in Wu-chen this morning by distributing
a large number of tracts and some Testaments.
The people seemed much surprised, and we could not
learn that any foreigner had been here before. We
preached twice&mdash;once in the temple of the God of War,
and afterwards in an empty space left by a fire, which had
completely destroyed many houses. In the afternoon we
preached again to a large and attentive audience on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
same site; and in the evening adjourned to a tea-shop,
where we had a good opportunity of speaking until it got
noised abroad that we were there, when, too many people
coming in, we were obliged to leave. Our native assistants,
Tsien and Kuei-hua, were able, however, to remain.
Returning to our boats, we spoke to a number of people
standing on a bridge, and felt we had abundant reason
to be thankful and encouraged by the result of our first
day's labour.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>January 10th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>First sent Tsien and Kuei-hua to distribute some sheet
tracts. After their return we went with them, and in a
space cleared by fire we separated, and addressed two
audiences. On our return to the boats for lunch, we
found people waiting, as usual, and desiring books. Some
were distributed to those who were able to read them; and
then asking them kindly to excuse us while we took our
midday meal, I went into my boat and shut the door.</p>

<p>Hardly was there time to pour out a cup of tea when a
battering began, and the roof was at once broken in. I
went out at the back, and found four or five men taking
the large lumps of frozen earth turned up in a field close
by&mdash;weighing, I should suppose, from seven to fourteen
pounds each&mdash;and throwing them at the boat. Remonstrance
was of no avail, and it was not long ere a considerable
part of the upper structure of the boat was broken to
pieces, and a quantity of earth covered the things inside.
Finally, Tsien got a boat that was passing to land him at a
short distance, and by a few tracts drew away the attention
of the men, thus ending the assault.</p>

<p>We now learned that of those who had done the
mischief only two were natives of the place, the others
being salt smugglers, and that the cause was our not
having satisfied their unreasonable demand for books.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Most providentially no one was injured; and as soon as
quiet was somewhat restored, we all met in Mr. Burns's
boat and joined in thanksgiving that we had been preserved
from personal harm, praying also for the perpetrators
of the mischief, and that it might be over-ruled for good to
us and to those with us. We then took our lunch and
went on shore, and but a few steps from the boats
addressed a large multitude that soon assembled. We
were specially assisted; never were we heard with more
attention, and not one voice was found to sympathise with
the men who had molested us. In the evening, at the
tea-shops, the same spirit was manifested, and some
seemed to hear with joy the glad tidings of salvation
through a crucified and risen <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>.</p>

<p>As we came home we passed a barber's shop still open,
and I went in, and while getting my head shaved had an
opportunity of speaking to a few people, and afterwards
pasted a couple of sheet tracts on the wall for the benefit
of future customers.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>January 11th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>A respectable shop-keeper of the name of Yao, who on
the first or second day of our stay at Wu-chen had received
portions of the New Testament and a tract, came yesterday,
when our boat was broken, to beg for some more books.
At that time we were all in confusion from the damage
done, and from the earth thrown into the boat, and so
invited him to come again in a day or two's time, when
we would gladly supply him. This morning he appeared
and handed in the following note:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On a former day I begged Burns and Taylor, the two
'<i>Rabbis</i>,' to give me good books. It happened at that
time those of our town whose hearts were deceived by
<i>Satan</i>, not knowing the <i>Son of David</i>, went so far as to
dare to '<i>raca</i>' and '<i>moreh</i>' and injure your respected boat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I thank you for promising afterwards to give the books,
and beg the following: Complete New Testament, 'Discourse
of a Good Man when near his Death,' 'Important

<p>This note is interesting, as showing that he had been
reading the New Testament attentively, as the italicised
words were all taken from it. His use of "raca" and
"moreh" for reviling, shows their meaning was not lost
upon him.</p>

<p>After supplying this man, we went out with Tsien and
Kuei-hua to the east of the town, and spoke in the street
for a short time. Upon returning to the boats, I was
visited by two <span class="smcap">Chih-li</span> men, who are in the magistrate's
office here. I was greatly helped in speaking to them of
a crucified <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> in the Mandarin dialect; and though
one of them did not pay much attention, the other did,
and made inquiries that showed the interest he was feeling.
When they had left, I went on shore and spoke to the
people collected there, to whom Kuei-hua had been preaching.
The setting sun afforded a parable, and reminded one
of the words of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, "The night cometh, when no man
can work;" and as I spoke of the uncertain duration of
this life, and of our ignorance as to the time of <span class="smcap">Christ's</span>
return, a degree of deep seriousness prevailed that I had
never previously witnessed in China. I engaged in prayer,
and the greatest decorum was observed. I then returned
to my boat with a Buddhist priest who had been in the
audience, and he admitted that Buddhism was a system
of deceit that could give no hope in death.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>January 12th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>In the afternoon we addressed the people on shore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
close to our boats, also in one of the streets of the city,
and in a tea-shop, books being distributed on each occasion.
In the evening we went as usual to speak in the
tea-shops, but determined to go to the opposite end of the
town, in order to afford those who lived there a better
opportunity of meeting with us. It was a long straggling
place, nearly two English miles in length. As Mr. Burns
and I were accustomed to talk together in Chinese, this
conclusion was known to those in the boats.</p>

<p>After we had proceeded a short distance we changed
our minds, and went instead to the usual tea-shop, thinking
that persons might have gone there expecting to meet us.
But this was not the case; and we did not find such serious
hearers as we had done on previous occasions. On this
account Mr. Burns proposed leaving earlier than usual, and
we did so, telling Tsien and Kuei-hua that they might remain
a little longer. Returning to the boats, we gave away
a few books; but, singularly enough, were left to go alone,
no one accompanying us, as is so generally the case. Instead
of being a clear night, as it was when we started, we found
that it had become intensely dark. On our way we met
the boatman, whose manner seemed very strange, and
without giving us any explanation he blew out the candle
of our lantern; we relighted the lantern, telling him not to
put it out again, when to our surprise he deliberately removed
the candle and threw it into the canal. He then
walked down along a low wall jutting out to the river's edge,
and gazed into the water.</p>

<p>Not knowing what was the matter with him, I ran
forward to hold him, fearful lest he were going to drown
himself; but to my great relief he came quietly back. In
answer to our repeated questions he told us not to speak,
for some bad men were seeking to destroy the boats,
and they had moved away to avoid them. He then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
led us to the place where one of them was lying. Before
long Tsien and Kuei-hua came and got safely on board,
and soon after we were joined by the teacher Sung, and the
boat moved away.</p>

<p>The cause of all this disturbance was then explained.
A man professing to be the constable had come to the
boats in our absence, with a written demand for ten
dollars and a quantity of opium. He stated that there
were more than fifty country people (salt smugglers)
awaiting our reply in an adjoining tea-shop; and if we
gave them what they wanted, and three hundred cash to
pay for their tea, we might remain in peace; but that if
not, they would come at once and destroy our boats.
Sung told them that we could not comply with their
demand; for, not being engaged in trade, but only in
preaching and book-distribution, we had not an atom of
opium, and that our money was nearly all expended. The
man, however, told him plainly that he did not believe
him, and Sung had no alternative but to seek us out,
desiring the man to await our reply. Not knowing that
we had changed our plans, he sought us in the wrong
direction, and of course in vain.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the boatmen had succeeded in
moving off. They were very much alarmed; and having
so recently had proof of what these men would do in open
daylight, felt no desire to experience what they might
attempt by night. Moving away, therefore, they had
separated, so that if one boat should be injured the other
might afford us a refuge. It was after this that we had
providentially met the boatman, and had been safely led on
board. As Sung repassed the place where we were previously
moored, he saw between the trees a dozen or more
men, and heard them inquiring where the boats had gone
to; but no one could tell. Fortunately they sought in vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while the two boats joined, and rowed together
for some time. It was already late, and to travel by night
in that part of the country was not the way to avoid danger
from evil men; so the question arose as to what should be
done. This we left for the boatmen to decide; they had
moved off of their own accord, and we felt that whatever
we personally might desire we could not constrain others
to remain in a position of danger on our account. We
urged them, however, to do quickly whatever they intended
to do, as the morrow was the <span class="smcap">Lord's Day</span>, when we should
not wish to travel. We also informed them that wherever
we were we must fulfil our mission, and preach the Gospel;
it therefore made but little difference where we might stay,
for even if we passed the night unperceived, we were sure
to be found out on the following morning. The men consequently
concluded that we might as well return to the
place from which we had started; to this we fully agreed,
and they turned back accordingly. But&mdash;whether by accident
or no we could not tell&mdash;they got into another stream,
and rowed for some time they knew not whither. At last,
as it was very dark, they moored for the night.</p>

<p>We then called all the boatmen together, with our
native assistants, and read to them the ninety-first Psalm.
It may be imagined how appropriate to our position and
need and how sweetly consoling was this portion of <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Word:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>

</div>

<p>Committing ourselves in prayer to His care and keeping
Who had covered us with thick darkness and permitted
us to escape from the hand of the violent, we retired for
the night; which&mdash;thanks to the kind protection of the
<span class="smcap">Watchman of Israel</span>, who neither slumbers nor forgets
His people&mdash;we passed in peace and quietness, and were
enabled, in some measure, to realise the truth of that
precious word, "<i>Thou</i> art my <i>Hiding-place</i>, and my <i>Shield</i>."</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>Sunday, January 13th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>This morning I was awakened about 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> by violent
pain in the knee-joint. I had bruised it the day before,
and severe inflammation was the result. To my great
surprise I heard the rain pouring down in torrents, the
weather having previously been particularly fine. On looking
out, we found ourselves so near our former stopping-place,
that, had nothing happened to prevent it, we should
not have felt justified in neglecting to go into the town to
preach as usual; but the rain was so heavy all day that
no one could leave the boats. Thus we enjoyed a delightful
day of rest, such as we had not had for some time; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the weather prevented much inquiry being made for us.
Had the day been fine we should most likely have been
discovered, even if we had not left the boats. As it was,
we were allowed to think in peace, with wonder and
gratitude, of the gracious dealings of our <span class="smcap">God</span>, who had
thus led us apart into "a desert place" to rest awhile.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>Monday, January 14th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>A cloudless morning. One of the native assistants
went before daybreak to get some clothes which had been
given out for washing. He came back with the tidings
that, notwithstanding the drenching rain of yesterday, men
had been seeking us in all directions. We had been kept,
however, in peace and safety "under the shadow of the
Almighty."</p>

<p>The boatmen were now so thoroughly alarmed that
they would stay no longer, and moved off at dawn. I was
confined to my quarters by lameness, and had no alternative
but to go with them. In the afternoon we reached
Ping-wang, on the way to Shanghai.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>CALLED TO SWATOW</h3>


<div class='cap'>HAVING to leave the neighbourhood of Black Town
thus unexpectedly was a real disappointment to
us, as we had hoped to spend some time evangelising in
that district. We were to prove, however, that no unforeseen
mischance had happened, but that these circumstances
which seemed so trying were necessary links in the chain
of a divinely ordered providence, guiding to other and
wider spheres.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> does not permit persecution to arise without
sufficient reason.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was leading us by a way that we
knew not; but it was none the less His way.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, how happy should we be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If we would cast our care on Thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If we from self would rest;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And feel at heart that One above,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In perfect wisdom, perfect love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is working for the best!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>When we reached Shanghai, thinking to return inland
in a few days with fresh supplies of books and money, we
met a Christian captain who had been trading at Swatow,
and he put very strongly before us the need of that region,
and the fact that there were British merchants living on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Double Island, selling opium and engaged in the coolie
trade (practically a slave traffic), while there was no British
missionary to preach the Gospel. The <span class="smcap">Spirit of God</span>
impressed me with the feeling that this was His call, but
for days I felt that I could not obey it. I had never had
such a spiritual father as Mr. Burns; I had never known
such holy, happy fellowship; and I said to myself that it
could not be <span class="smcap">God's</span> will that we should separate.</p>

<p>In great unrest of soul I went one evening, with Mr. Burns,
to take tea at the house of the Rev. R. Lowrie, of
the American Presbyterian Mission, at the South Gate of
Shanghai. After tea Mrs. Lowrie played over to us "The
Missionary Call."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I had never heard it before, and it
greatly affected me. My heart was almost broken before
it was finished, and I said to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, in the words that
had been sung&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"And I will go!</span><br />
I may no longer doubt to give up friends, and idol hopes,<br />
And every tie that binds my heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
Henceforth, then, it matters not, if storm or sunshine be my earthly lot, bitter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">or sweet my cup;</span><br />
I only pray, <span class="smcap">God</span>, make me holy,<br />
And my spirit nerve for the stern hour of strife."<br />
</div>

<p>Upon leaving I asked Mr. Burns to come home with
me to the little house that was still my headquarters in the
native city, and there, with many tears, told him how the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> had been leading me, and how rebellious I had been
and unwilling to leave him for this new sphere of labour.
He listened with a strange look of surprise, and of pleasure
rather than pain; and answered that he had determined
that very night to tell me that he had heard the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span>
call to Swatow, and that his one regret had been the
prospect of the severance of our happy fellowship. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
went together; and thus was recommenced missionary work
in that part of China, which in later years has been so
abundantly blessed.</p>

<p>Long before this time the Rev. R. Lechler, of the Basel
Missionary Society, had widely itinerated in the neighbourhood
of Swatow and the surrounding regions. Driven
about from place to place, he had done work that was not
forgotten, although ultimately he was obliged to retire to
Hong-kong. For more than forty years this earnest-hearted
servant of <span class="smcap">God</span> has continued in "labours more abundant";
and quite recently he has left Hong-kong, with his devoted
wife, to return again inland, and spend the strength of his
remaining years amongst the people he has so long and
truly loved.</p>

<p>Captain Bowers, the Christian friend who had been used
of <span class="smcap">God</span> in bringing the needs of Swatow before Mr. Burns
and myself, was overjoyed when he heard of our decision
to devote ourselves to the evangelisation of that busy,
important, and populous mart. Being about to sail himself
on his return journey, he gladly offered us free passages on
board the <i>Geelong</i>, in which we left Shanghai early in the
month of March 1856.</p>

<p>A favourable journey of six days brought us to Double
Island, where we found ourselves landed in the midst of a
small but very ungodly community of foreigners, engaged in
the opium trade and other commercial enterprises. Unwilling
to be in any way identified with these fellow-countrymen,
we were most desirous of obtaining quarters at once within
the native city, situated on a promontory of the mainland,
five miles farther up, at the mouth of the Han river.
Great difficulty was experienced in this attempt to obtain
a footing amongst the people. Indeed, it seemed as
though we should fail altogether, and we were helplessly
cast upon the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in prayer. Our <span class="smcap">God</span> soon undertook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
for us. Meeting one day with a Cantonese merchant, a
relative of the highest official in the town, Mr. Burns
addressed him in the Cantonese dialect; this gentleman
was so pleased at being spoken to by a foreigner in his
own tongue that he became our friend, and secured us a
lodging. We had only one little room, however, and not
easily shall I forget the long hot summer months in that
oven-like place, where towards the eaves one could touch
the heated tiles with one's hand. More room or better
accommodation it was impossible to obtain.</p>

<p>We varied our stay by visits to the surrounding country;
but the difficulties and dangers that encountered us here
were so great and constant, that our former work in the
North began to appear safe and easy in comparison. The
hatred and contempt of the Cantonese was very painful,
"foreign devil," "foreign dog," or "foreign pig" being the
commonest appellations; but all this led us into deeper
fellowship than I had ever known before with Him who
was "despised and rejected of men."</p>

<p>In our visits to the country we were liable to be seized
at any time and held to ransom; and the people commonly
declared that the whole district was "without emperor,
without ruler, and without law." Certainly, might was
right in those days. On one occasion we were visiting a
small town, and found that the inhabitants had captured
a wealthy man of another clan. A large ransom was
demanded for his release, and on his refusing to pay it
they had smashed his ankle-bones, one by one, with a club,
and thus extorted the promise they desired. There was
nothing but <span class="smcap">God's</span> protection to prevent our being treated
in the same way. The towns were all walled, and one
such place would contain ten or twenty thousand people
of the same clan and surname, who were frequently at war
with the people living in the next town. To be kindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
received in one place was not uncommonly a source of
danger in the next. In circumstances such as these the
preserving care of our <span class="smcap">God</span> was often manifested.</p>

<p>After a time the local mandarin became ill, and the
native doctors were unable to relieve him. He had heard
from some who had been under my treatment of the benefit
derived, and was led to seek our help. <span class="smcap">God</span> blessed
the medicines given, and grateful for relief, he advised our
renting a house for a hospital and dispensary. Having his
permission, we were able to secure the entire premises, one
room of which we had previously occupied. I had left my
stock of medicine and surgical instruments under the care
of my friend, the late Mr. Wylie, in Shanghai, and went
back at once to fetch them.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns came down from a town called Am-po, that
we had visited together several times, to see me off, and
returned again when I had sailed, with two native evangelists
sent up from Hong-kong by the Rev. J. Johnson, of
the American Baptist Missionary Union. The people were
willing to listen to their preaching, and to accept their
books as a gift, but they would not buy them. One night
robbers broke in and carried off everything they had, with
the exception of their stock of literature, which was supposed
to be valueless. Next morning, very early, they
were knocked up by persons wishing to buy books, and the
sales continued; so that by breakfast time they had not
only cash enough to procure food, but to pay also for the
passage of one of the men to Double Island, below Swatow,
with a letter to Mr. Burns's agent to supply him with
money. Purchasers continued coming during that day
and the next, and our friends lacked nothing; but on the
third day they could not sell a single book. Then, however,
when the cash from their sales was just exhausted,
the messenger returned with supplies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>It was early in July, after about four months' residence
in Swatow, that I left for Shanghai, intending to return in
the course of a few weeks, bringing with me my medical
apparatus, for further work in association with the Rev.
William Burns. A new and promising field seemed to be
opening before us, and it was with much hopeful anticipation
that we looked forward to the future of the work.
Marked blessing was indeed in store for the city and
neighbourhood of Swatow; but it was not the purpose of
<span class="smcap">God</span> that either of us should remain to reap the harvest.
Mr. Burns while in the interior was taken up and imprisoned
by the Chinese authorities soon after I left, and was sent to
Canton. And though he returned to Swatow after the war
had broken out, he was called away for other service, which
prevented his subsequent return; while my journey to
Shanghai proved to be the first step in a diverging pathway
leading to other spheres.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>MAN PROPOSES, GOD DISPOSES</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT is interesting to notice the various events which
united, in the providence of <span class="smcap">God</span>, in preventing my
return to Swatow, and ultimately led to my settling in
Ningpo, and making that the centre for the development
of future labours.</div>

<p>Upon reaching Shanghai, great was my dismay to find
that the premises in which my medicines and instruments
had been stored were burnt down, and that all the
medicines and many of the instruments were entirely
destroyed. To me this appeared a great calamity, and I
fear I was more disposed with faithless Jacob to say, "All
these things are against me," than to recognise that "All
things work together for good." I had not then learned
to think of <span class="smcap">God</span> as the One Great Circumstance "in Whom
we live, and move, and have our being"; and of <i>all</i> lesser,
external circumstances, as necessarily the kindest, wisest,
best, because either ordered or permitted by Him. Hence
my disappointment and trial were very great.</p>

<p>Medicines were expensive in Shanghai, and my means
were limited. I therefore set out on an inland journey to
Ningpo, hoping to obtain a supply from Dr. William
Parker, a member of the same mission as myself. I took
with me my few remaining possessions, the principal being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
my watch, a few surgical instruments, a concertina, books
for the study of Chinese, which in those days were very
expensive; but left behind in Shanghai a portion of my
money.</p>

<p>The country through which I had to pass was suffering
much from drought; it was the height of summer; and
the water in the Grand Canal was very low, having been
largely drawn upon for the neighbouring rice fields, as well
as evaporated by the intense heat. I had determined to
make the journey as much of a mission tour as possible,
and set out well supplied with Christian tracts and books.
After fourteen days spent in travelling slowly through the
populous country, preaching and distributing books, etc.,
we reached a large town called Shih-mun-wan, and here,
finding that my supply of literature was exhausted, I determined
not to linger over the rest of the journey, but to
reach Ningpo as speedily as possible, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the city of
Hai-ning.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>August 4th, 1856.</i><br />
</div>

<p>There was no water beyond Shih-mun-wan, so I paid off
my boat, hired coolies to carry my things as far as to
Chang-gan, and ere sunrise we were on the way. I walked
on alone, leaving my servant to follow with the men, who
made frequent stoppages to rest; and on reaching a city
through which we had to pass, I waited for them in a
tea-shop just outside the North Gate. The coolies came
on very slowly, and seemed tired when they arrived. I
soon found that they were both opium-smokers, so that,
although they had only carried a load that one strong man
would think nothing of taking three times the distance,
they really seemed wearied.</p>

<p>After some rice and tea and an hour's rest&mdash;including,
I doubt not, a smoke of the opium pipe&mdash;they were a
little refreshed, and I proposed moving on, that we might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
get to Chang-gan before the sun became too powerful. My
servant, however, had a friend in the city, and he desired
to spend the day there, and to go on next morning. But
to this I objected, wishing to reach Hai-ning that night if
possible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We therefore set off, entered the North
Gate, and had passed through about a third of the city,
when the coolies stopped to rest, and said they should be
unable to carry the burden on to Chang-gan. Finally,
they agreed to take it to the South Gate, where they were
to be paid in proportion to the distance they had carried
it; and the servant undertook to call other coolies and
come along with them.</p>

<p>I walked on before as in the first instance, and the
distance being only about four miles, soon reached Chang-gan,
and waited their arrival, meanwhile engaging coolies
for the rest of the journey to Hai-ning. Having waited a
long time, I began to wonder at the delay; and at length
it became too late to finish the journey to Hai-ning that
night. I felt somewhat annoyed; and but that my feet
were blistered, and the afternoon very hot, I should have
gone back to meet them and urge them on. At last I
concluded that my servant must have gone to his friend's,
and would not appear until evening. But evening came,
and still there was no sign of them.</p>

<p>Feeling very uneasy, I began diligently to inquire
whether they had been seen. At last a man responded,
"Are you a guest from Shih-mun-wan?" I answered
in the affirmative. "Are you going to Hai-ning?"
"That is my destination." "Then your things have
gone on before you; for I was sitting in a tea-shop
when a coolie came in, took a cup of tea, and set off for
Hai-ning in a great hurry, saying that the bamboo box
and bed he carried, which were just such as you describe
yours to have been, were from Shih-mun-wan, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
had to take them to Hai-ning to-night, where he was to
be paid at the rate of ten cash a pound." From this I
concluded that my goods were on before me; but it
was impossible to follow them at once, for I was too tired
to walk, and it was already dark.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances all I could do was to seek
a lodging for the night; and no easy task I found it.
After raising my heart to <span class="smcap">God</span> to ask His aid, I walked
through to the farther end of the town, where I thought
the tidings of a foreigner's being in the place might not
have spread, and looked out for an inn. I soon came to
one, and went in, hoping that I might pass unquestioned,
as it was already dark. Asking the bill of fare, I was told
that cold rice&mdash;which proved to be more than "rather
burnt"&mdash;and snakes, fried in lamp-oil, were all that could
be had. Not wishing any question to be raised as to my
nationality, I was compelled to order some, and tried to
make a meal, but with little success.</p>

<p>While thus engaged I said to the landlord, "I suppose
I can arrange to spend the night here?"</p>

<p>To which he replied in the affirmative; but bringing
out his book, he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"In these unsettled times we are required by the
authorities to keep a record of our lodgers: may I
ask your respected family name?"</p>

<p>"My unworthy family name is Tai," I responded.</p>

<p>"And your honourable second name?"</p>

<p>"My humble name is Ia-koh" (James).</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary name! I never heard it before.
How do you write it?"</p>

<p>I told him, and added, "It is a common name in the
district from which I come."</p>

<p>"And may I ask whence you come and whither you
are going?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am journeying from Shanghai to Ningpo, by way of
Hang-chau."</p>

<p>"What may be your honourable profession?"</p>

<p>"I heal the sick."</p>

<p>"Oh! you are a physician," the landlord remarked;
and to my intense relief closed the book. His wife,
however, took up the conversation.</p>

<p>"You are a physician, are you?" said she; "I am glad
of that, for I have a daughter afflicted with leprosy. If
you will cure her, you shall have your supper and bed for
nothing."</p>

<p>I was curious enough to inquire what my supper and
bed were to cost, if paid for; and to my amusement found
they were worth less than three-halfpence of our money!</p>

<p>Being unable to benefit the girl, I declined to prescribe
for her, saying that leprosy was a very intractable disease,
and that I had no medicines with me.</p>

<p>The mother, however, brought pen and paper, urging,
"You can at least write a prescription, which will do no
harm, if it does no good."</p>

<p>But this also I declined to do, and requested to be
shown my bed. I was conducted to a very miserable room
on the ground-floor, where, on some boards raised upon
two stools, I passed the night, without bed or pillow,
save my umbrella and shoe, and without any mosquito
netting. Ten or eleven other lodgers were sleeping in the
same room, so I could not take anything off, for fear of
its being stolen; but I was, I found, by no means too
warm as midnight came on.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>August 5th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>As may be supposed, I arose but little rested or refreshed,
and felt very far from well. I had to wait a long time ere
breakfast was obtainable, and then there was another delay
before I could get change for the only dollar I had with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
me, in consequence of its being chipped in one or two
places. More than three hundred cash also were deducted
from its price on this account, which was a serious loss to
me in my trying position.</p>

<p>I then sought throughout the town for tidings of my
servant and coolies, as I thought it possible that they
might have arrived later, or have come on in the morning.
The town is large, long, and straggling, being nearly two
miles from one end to the other, so this occupied some
time. I gained no information, however; and, footsore
and weary, set out for Hai-ning in the full heat of the day.
The journey&mdash;about eight miles&mdash;took me a long time;
but a halfway village afforded a resting-place and a cup of
tea, both of which I gladly availed myself of. When about
to leave again, a heavy shower of rain came on, and the
delay thus occasioned enabled me to speak a little to the
people about the truths of the Gospel.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far spent before I approached the
northern suburb of Hai-ning, where I commenced inquiries,
but could hear no tidings of my servant or things. I was
told that outside the East Gate I should be more likely to
hear of them, as it was there the sea-junks called. I therefore
proceeded thither, and sought for them outside the
Little East Gate, but in vain. Very weary, I sat down in a
tea-shop to rest; and while there a number of persons from
one of the mandarin's offices came in, and made inquiries
as to who I was, where I had come from, etc. On learning
the object of my search, one of the men in the tea-shop
said, "A bamboo box and a bed, such as you describe,
were carried past here about half an hour ago. The bearer
seemed to be going towards either the Great East Gate or
the South Gate; you had better go to the hongs there and
inquire." I asked him to accompany me in the search,
and promised to reward him for his trouble, but he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
not. Another man offered to go with me, so we set off
together, and both inside and outside the two gates made
diligent inquiries, but all in vain. I then engaged a man
to make a thorough search, promising him a liberal reward
if he should be successful. In the meantime I had some
dinner, and addressed a large concourse of people who had
gathered together.</p>

<p>When he returned, having met with no success, I said
to him, "I am now quite exhausted: will you help me to
find quarters for the night, and then I will pay you for your
trouble?" He was willing to befriend me, and we set off
in search of lodgings. At the first place or two the people
would not receive me; for though on our first going in
they seemed willing to do so, the presence of a man who
followed us, and who, I found, was engaged in one of the
Government offices, seemed to alarm them, and I was refused.
We now went to a third place, and being no longer
followed by the mandarin's messenger, we were promised
quarters; some tea was brought, and I paid the man who
had accompanied me for his trouble.</p>

<p>Soon after he was gone some official people came in;
they soon went away, but the result of their visit was that I
was told I could not be entertained there that night. A
young man present blamed them for their heartless behaviour,
and said, "Never mind, come with me; and if
we cannot get better lodgings for you, you shall sleep at
our house." I went with him, but we found the people of
his house unwilling to receive me. Weary and footsore, so
that I could scarcely stand, I had again to seek quarters,
and at length got promise of them; but a little crowd
collecting about the door, they desired me to go to a tea-shop
and wait there till the people had retired, or they
would be unable to accommodate me. There was no help
for it, so I went, accompanied still by the young man, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
waited till past midnight. Then we left for the promised
resting-place; but my conductor would not find it, and he
led me about to another part of the city; and finally,
between one and two o'clock, he left me to pass the rest
of the night as best I could.</p>

<p>I was opposite a temple, but it was closed; so I lay
down on the stone steps in front of it, and putting my
money under my head for a pillow, should soon have been
asleep in spite of the cold had I not perceived a person
coming stealthily towards me. As he approached I saw he
was one of the beggars so common in China, and had no
doubt his intention was to rob me of my money. I did
not stir, but watched his movements, and looked to my
<span class="smcap">Father</span> not to leave me in this hour of trial. The man
came up, looked at me for some time to assure himself
that I was asleep (it was so dark that he could not see my
eyes fixed on him), and then began to feel about me gently.
I said to him in the quietest tone, but so as to convince
him that I was not, nor had been, sleeping, "What do you
want?" He made no answer, but went away.</p>

<p>I was very thankful to see him go, and when he was out
of sight put as much of my cash as would not go into my
pocket safely up my sleeve, and made my pillow of a stone
projection of the wall. It was not long ere I began to
doze, but I was aroused by the all but noiseless footsteps
of two persons approaching; for my nervous system was
rendered so sensitive by exhaustion that the slightest noise
startled me. Again I sought protection from Him who
alone was my stay, and lay still as before, till one of them
came up and began to feel under my head for the cash. I
spoke again, and they sat down at my feet. I asked them
what they were doing; they replied that they, like me,
were going to pass the night there. I then requested them
to take the opposite side, as there was plenty of room, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
leave this side to me; but they would not move from my
feet, so I raised myself up and set my back against the
wall.</p>

<p>They said, "You had better lie down and sleep; if you
do not, you will be unable to walk to-morrow. Do not be
afraid; we shall not leave you, and will see that no one
hurts you."</p>

<p>"Listen to me," I replied. "I do not want your protection;
I need it not; I am not a Chinese; I do not
worship your senseless, helpless idols. I worship <span class="smcap">God</span>;
He is my <span class="smcap">Father</span>; I trust in Him. I know well what
you are, and what your intentions are, and shall keep my
eye on you, and shall not sleep."</p>

<p>On this, one of them went away, but soon returned
with a third companion. I felt very uneasy, but looked to
<span class="smcap">God</span> for help. Once or twice one of them got up to see
if I was asleep. I only said, "Do not be mistaken; I am
not sleeping." Occasionally my head dropped, and this
was a signal for one of them to rise; but I at once roused
myself and made some remark. As the night slowly
passed on, I felt very weary; and to keep myself awake,
as well as to cheer my mind, I sang several hymns, repeated
aloud some portions of Scripture, and engaged in prayer
in English, to the great annoyance of my companions, who
seemed as if they would have given anything to get me to
desist. After that they troubled me no more; and shortly
before dawn of day they left me, and I got a little sleep.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>August 6th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I was awakened by the young man who had so misled
me on the previous evening. He was very rude, and
insisted on my getting up and paying him for his trouble,
and even went so far as to try to accomplish by force
what he wanted. This roused me; and in an unguarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
moment, with very improper feeling, I seized his arm with
such a grasp as he little expected I was capable of, and
dared him to lay a finger upon me again or to annoy me
further. This quite changed his manner; he let me quietly
remain till the guns announced the opening of the gates of
the city, and then he begged me to give him some money
to buy opium with. It is needless to say this was refused.
I gave him the price of two candles, that he said he had
burnt while with me last night and no more. I learned he
was connected with one of the mandarin's offices.</p>

<p>As soon as possible, I bought some rice gruel and tea
for breakfast, and then once more made a personal search
after my things. Some hours thus spent proving unavailing,
I set out on the return journey, and after a long, weary,
and painful walk reached Chang-gan about noon. Here
also my inquiries failed to give me any trace of the missing
goods; so I had a meal cooked in a tea-shop, got a
thorough wash and bathed my inflamed feet, and after
dinner rested and slept till four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Much refreshed, I then set on to return to the city, at
the South Gate of which I had parted with my servant and
coolies two days before. On the way I was led to reflect
on the goodness of <span class="smcap"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: God here not printed in small capitals in original">God</ins></span>, and recollected that I had not
made it a matter of prayer that I might be provided with
lodgings last night. I felt condemned, too, that I should
have been so anxious for my few things, while the many
precious souls around me had caused so little emotion. I
came as a sinner and pleaded the blood of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, realising
that I was accepted in Him&mdash;pardoned, cleansed, sanctified&mdash;and
oh the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, how great I felt it to be! I
knew something more than I had ever previously known
of what it was to be despised and rejected, and to have
nowhere to lay one's head; and I felt more than ever I had
done before the greatness of that love which induced Him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to leave His home in glory and suffer thus for me; nay, to
lay down His very life upon the Cross. I thought of Him
as "despised and rejected of men, a Man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief"; I thought of Him at Jacob's well,
weary, hungry, and thirsty, yet finding it His meat and
drink to do His Father's will; and contrasted this with
my littleness of love. I looked to Him for pardon for the
past, and for grace and strength to do His will in the future,
to tread more closely in His footsteps, and be more than
ever wholly His. I prayed for myself, for friends in
England, and for my brethren in the work. Sweet tears of
mingled joy and sorrow flowed freely, the road was almost
forgotten, and before I was aware of it I had reached my
destination. Outside the South Gate I took a cup of tea,
asked about my lost luggage, and spoke of the love of
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>. Then I entered the city, and after many vain inquiries
left it by the North Gate.</p>

<p>I felt so much refreshed both in mind and body by the
communion I had on my walk to the city that I thought
myself able to finish the remaining six miles back to Shih-mun-wan
that evening. First I went into another tea-shop
to buy some native cakes, and was making a meal of them
when who should come in but one of the identical coolies
who had carried my things the first stage. From him I
learned that after I left them they had taken my luggage
to the South Gate; there my servant went away, saying on
his return that I had gone on, that he did not intend to
start at once, but would spend the day with his friend, and
then rejoin me; they carried the things to this friend's
house, and left them there. I got him to go with me to the
house, and there learned that the man had spent the day
and night with them, and next morning had called other
coolies, and set off for Hang-chau. This was all I could
gather; so, unable to do anything but proceed on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
return journey to Shanghai with all expedition, I left the
city again. It was now too late to go on to Shih-mun-wan.
I looked to my <span class="smcap">Father</span> as able to supply all my need, and
received another token of His ceaseless love and care,
being invited to sleep on a hong-boat, now dry in the bed
of the river. The night was again very cold and the
mosquitoes troublesome. Still, I got a little rest, and at
sunrise was up and continued my journey.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>August 7th.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I felt very ill at first, and had a sore throat, but reflected
on the wonderful goodness of <span class="smcap">God</span> in enabling me
to bear the heat by day and the cold by night so long. I
felt also that quite a load was now taken off my mind. I
had committed myself and my affairs to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
knew that if it was for my good and for His glory my
things would be restored; if not, all would be for the best.
I hoped that the most trying part of my journey was now
drawing to a close, and this helped me, weary and footsore,
on the way. When I got to Shih-mun-wan and had breakfasted,
I found I had still eight hundred and ten cash in
hand; and I knew that the hong-boat fare to Kia-hing Fu
was one hundred and twenty cash, and thence to Shanghai
three hundred and sixty, leaving me just three hundred
and thirty cash&mdash;or twelve pence and a fraction&mdash;for three
or four days provisions. I went at once to the boat office,
but to my dismay found that from the dry state of the
river goods had not come down, so that no boat would
leave to-day and perhaps none to-morrow. I inquired if
there were no letter-boats for Kia-hing Fu, and was told that
they had already left. The only remaining resource was to
ascertain if any private boats were going in which I could
get a passage. My search, however, was in vain; and I
could get no boat to undertake to go all the way to
Shanghai, or my difficulty would have been at an end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Just at this juncture I saw before me, at a turn in the
canal, a letter-boat going in the direction of Kia-hing Fu
This, I concluded, must be one of the Kia-hing boats that
had been unexpectedly detained, and I set off after it as
fast as hope and the necessities of the case would carry me.
For the time being weariness and sore feet were alike
forgotten. After a chase of about a mile I overtook it.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Kia-hing Fu?" I called out.</p>

<p>"No," was the only answer.</p>

<p>"Are you going in that direction?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Will you give me a passage as far as you do go that
way?"</p>

<p>Still "No," and nothing more.</p>

<p>Completely dispirited and exhausted, I sank down on
the grass and fainted away.</p>

<p>As consciousness returned some voices reached my ear,
and I found they were talking about me. One said, "He
speaks pure Shanghai dialect," and from their own speech
I knew them to be Shanghai people. Raising myself, I
saw that they were on a large hong-boat on the other side
of the canal, and after a few words they sent their small
boat to fetch me, and I went on board the junk. They
were very kind, and gave me some tea; and when I was
refreshed and able to partake of it, some food also. I then
took my shoes and stockings off to ease my feet, and the
boatman kindly provided me with hot water to bathe them.
When they heard my story, and saw the blisters on my feet,
they evidently pitied me, and hailed every boat that passed
to see if it was going my way. Not finding one, by and by,
after a few hours' sleep, I went ashore with the captain,
intending to preach in the temple of Kwan-ti.</p>

<p>Before leaving the junk I told the captain and those
on board that I was now unable to help myself; that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
had not strength to walk to Kia-hing Fu, and having been
disappointed in getting a passage to-day, I should no longer
have sufficient means to take me there by letter-boat, which
was an expensive mode of travelling; that I knew not how
the <span class="smcap">God</span> whom I served would help me, but that I had no
doubt He would do so; and that my business now was to
serve Him where I was. I also told them that the help
which I knew would come ought to be an evidence to them
of the truth of the religion which I and the other missionaries
at Shanghai preached.</p>

<p>On our way to the town, while engaged in conversation
with the captain, we saw a letter-boat coming up. The
captain drew my attention to it; but I reminded him that
I had no longer the means of paying my passage by it.
He hailed it, nevertheless, and found that it was going to
a place about nine English miles from Shanghai, whence
one of the boatmen would carry the mails overland to the
city. He then said, "This gentleman is a foreigner from
Shanghai, who has been robbed, and has no longer the
means of returning. If you will take him with you as far
as you go, and then engage a sedan chair to carry him the
rest of the way, he will pay you in Shanghai. You see my
boat is lying aground yonder for want of water, and cannot
get away. Now, I will stand surety; and if this gentleman
does not pay when you get to Shanghai, I will do so on
your return." This unsolicited kindness on the part of a
Chinaman, a perfect stranger, will appear the more remarkable
to any one acquainted with the character of the Chinese,
who are generally most reluctant to risk their money.
Those on the letter-boat agreeing to the terms, I was taken
on board as a passenger. Oh, how thankful I felt for this
providential interposition, and to be once more on my way
to Shanghai!</p>

<p>Letter-boats such as the one on which I was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
travelling are of a long narrow build, and very limited as
to their inside accommodation. One has to lie down all
the time they are in motion, as a slight movement would
easily upset them. This was no irksome condition to me,
however; on the contrary, I was only too glad to be quiet.
They are the quickest boats I have seen in China. Each
one is worked by two men, who relieve one another continuously
night and day. They row with their feet, and
paddle with their hands; or if the wind is quite favourable,
row with their feet, and with one hand manage a small
sail, while steering with the other.</p>

<p>After a pleasant and speedy journey, I reached Shanghai
in safety on August 9th, through the help of Him who has
said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee;" "Lo, I
am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>PROVIDENTIAL GUIDANCE</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT now seemed very clear that the lost property&mdash;including
everything I possessed in China, with the
exception of a small sum of money providentially left in
Shanghai&mdash;had been deliberately stolen by my servant,
who had gone off with it to Hang-chau. The first question,
of course, was how best to act for the good of the man who
had been the cause of so much trouble. It would not
have been difficult to take steps that would have led to his
punishment; though the likelihood of any reparation being
made for the loss sustained was very small. But the
consideration which weighed most heavily was that the
thief was a man for whose salvation I had laboured and
prayed; and I felt that to prosecute him would not be to
emphasise the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount, in
which we had read together, "Resist not evil," and other
similar precepts. Finally, concluding that his soul was of
more value than the &pound;40 worth of things I had lost, I
wrote and told him this, urging upon him his need of
repentance and faith in the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>. The
course I took commended itself to my Christian friends in
England, one of whom was afterwards led to send me a
cheque for &pound;40&mdash;the first of many subsequently received
from the same kind helper.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>Having obtained the little money left in Shanghai,
I again set out for Ningpo, to seek assistance from Dr. Parker
in replacing the medicines I had previously lost by
fire. This being satisfactorily accomplished, I returned
once more to Shanghai, <i>en route</i> for Swatow, hoping soon
to rejoin my much-loved friend, Mr. Burns, in the work in
that important centre. <span class="smcap">God</span> had willed it otherwise, however;
and the delay caused by the robbery was just sufficient to
prevent me from starting for the South as I had intended.</p>

<p>Over the political horizon storm-clouds had long been
gathering, precursors of coming war; and early in October
of this year (1856) the affair of the Lorcha <i>Arrow</i> at
Canton led to the definite commencement of hostilities.
Very soon China was deeply involved in a second prolonged
struggle with foreign powers; and missionary operations,
in the South at any rate, had to be largely suspended.
Tidings of these events, together with letters from Mr.
Burns, arrived just in time to meet me in Shanghai as
I was leaving for Swatow; and thus hindered, I could not
but realise the hand of <span class="smcap">God</span> in closing the door I had so
much desired to enter.</p>

<p>While in Ningpo, I had made the acquaintance of Mr.
John Jones, who, with Dr. Parker, represented the Chinese
Evangelisation Society in that city. Hindered from returning
to Swatow, I now decided to join these brethren in
the Ningpo work, and set out at once upon the journey.
On the afternoon of the second day, when already about
thirty miles distant from Shanghai, Mr. Jones and I drew
near the large and important city of Sung-kiang, and I
spoke of going ashore to preach the Gospel to the thronging
multitudes that lined the banks and crowded the
approaches to the city gates.</p>

<p>Among the passengers on board the boat was one
intelligent man, who in the course of his travels had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a good deal abroad, and had even visited England, where
he went by the name of Peter. As might be expected,
he had heard something of the Gospel, but had never
experienced its saving power. On the previous evening
I had drawn him into earnest converse about his soul's
salvation. The man listened with attention, and was
even moved to tears, but still no definite result was
apparent. I was pleased, therefore, when he asked to be
allowed to accompany me, and to hear me preach.</p>

<p>I went into the cabin of the boat to prepare tracts and
books for distribution on landing with my Chinese friend,
when suddenly I was startled by a splash and a cry from
without. I sprang on deck, and took in the situation
at a glance. Peter was gone! The other men were all
there, on board, looking helplessly at the spot where he
had disappeared, but making no effort to save him. A
strong wind was carrying the junk rapidly forward in spite
of a steady current in the opposite direction, and the low-lying,
shrubless shore afforded no landmark to indicate
how far we had left the drowning man behind.</p>

<p>I instantly let down the sail and leapt overboard in the
hope of finding him. Unsuccessful, I looked around in
agonising suspense, and saw close to me a fishing-boat
with a peculiar drag-net furnished with hooks, which I
knew would bring him up.</p>

<p>"Come!" I cried, as hope revived in my heart.
"Come and drag over this spot directly; a man is
drowning just here!"</p>

<p>"Veh bin" (It is not convenient), was the unfeeling
answer.</p>

<p>"Don't talk of <i>convenience!</i>" cried I in an agony; "a
man is drowning, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"We are busy fishing," they responded, "and cannot
come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind your fishing," I said, "I will give you
more money than many a day's fishing will bring; only
come&mdash;come at once!"</p>

<p>"How much money will you give us?"</p>

<p>"We cannot stay to discuss that now! Come, or it
will be too late. I will give you five dollars" (then worth
about thirty shillings in English money).</p>

<p>"We won't do it for that," replied the men. "Give us
twenty dollars, and we will drag."</p>

<p>"I do not possess so much: do come quickly, and I
will give you all I have!"</p>

<p>"How much may that be?"</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know exactly, about fourteen dollars."</p>

<p>At last, but even then slowly enough, the boat was
paddled over, and the net let down. Less than a minute
sufficed to bring up the body of the missing man. The
fishermen were clamorous and indignant because their exorbitant
demand was delayed while efforts at resuscitation
were being made. But all was in vain&mdash;life was extinct.</p>

<p>To myself this incident was profoundly sad and full of
significance, suggesting a far more mournful reality. Were
not those fishermen actually guilty of this poor Chinaman's
death, in that they had the means of saving him at hand,
if they would but have used them? Assuredly they were
guilty. And yet, let us pause ere we pronounce judgment
against them, lest a greater than Nathan answer, "<i>Thou art
the man</i>." Is it so hard-hearted, so wicked a thing to
neglect to save the body? Of how much sorer punishment,
then, is he worthy who leaves the soul to perish,
and Cain-like says, "Am I my brother's keeper?" The
<span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> commands, commands <i>me</i>, commands <i>you</i>,
my brother, and <i>you</i>, my sister. "Go," says He, "go ye
into <i>all</i> the world, and preach the Gospel to <i>every</i> creature."
Shall we say to <i>Him</i>, "No, it is not convenient"? shall we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
tell <i>Him</i> that we are busy fishing and cannot go? that we
have bought a piece of ground and cannot go? that we
have purchased five yoke of oxen, or have married, or are
engaged in other and more interesting pursuits, and cannot
go? Ere long "we must all appear before the judgment
seat of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; that every one may receive the things done
in his body." Let us remember, let us pray for, let us
labour for the unevangelised Chinese; <i>or we shall sin
against our own souls</i>. Let us consider <i>Who</i> it is that
has said, "If thou <i>forbear</i> to deliver them that are drawn
unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; if thou
sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not He that pondereth
the heart consider it? and He that keepeth <i>thy</i> soul,
doth not he know it? and shall not He render to every
man according to his works?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>SETTLEMENT IN NINGPO</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE autumn of 1856 was well advanced before I
reached Ningpo, one of the most ancient and
influential cities on the coast of China. Opened to the
residence of foreigners in 1842 by the treaty of Nan-king,
it had long been the scene of missionary labours.
Within its thronging thoroughfares the busy tide of life
runs high. Four hundred thousand human beings dwell
within or around the five miles circuit of its ancient
wall, every one a soul that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> loves, for whom He
died.</div>

<p>As winter drew on I rented a native house in Wu-gyiao-deo,
or Lake Head Street. It was not then a very
comfortable residence. I have a very distinct remembrance
of tracing my initials on the snow which during the
night had collected upon my coverlet in the large barn-like
upper room, now subdivided into four or five smaller ones,
each of which is comfortably ceiled. The tiling of an
unceiled Chinese house may keep off the rain&mdash;if it happens
to be sound&mdash;but it does not afford so good a protection
against snow, which will beat up through crannies and
crevices, and find its way within. But however unfinished
may have been its fittings, the little house was well adapted
for work amongst the people; and there I thankfully settled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
down, finding ample scope for service,&mdash;morning, noon,
and night.</p>

<p>During the latter part of this year my mind was greatly
exercised about continued connection with my Society, it
being frequently in debt. Personally I had always avoided
debt, and kept within my salary, though at times only by
very careful economy. Now there was no difficulty in
doing this, for my income was larger, and the country being
in a more peaceful state, things were not so dear. But the
Society itself was in debt. The quarterly bills which I and
others were instructed to draw were often met by borrowed
money, and a correspondence commenced which terminated
in the following year by my resigning from conscientious
motives.</p>

<p>To me it seemed that the teaching of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word was
unmistakably clear: "Owe no man any thing." To borrow
money implied, to my mind, a contradiction of Scripture&mdash;a
confession that <span class="smcap">God</span> had withheld some good thing, and a
determination to get for ourselves what He had not given.
Could that which was wrong for one Christian to do be
right for an association of Christians? Or could any
amount of precedents make a wrong course justifiable? If
the Word taught me anything, it taught me to have no
connection with debt. I could not think that <span class="smcap">God</span> was
poor, that He was short of resources, or unwilling to supply
any want of whatever work was really His. It seemed to
me that if there were lack of funds to carry on work, then
to that degree, in that special development, or at that time,
it could not be the work of <span class="smcap">God</span>. To satisfy my conscience
I was therefore compelled to resign connection with the
Society which had hitherto supplied my salary.</p>

<p>It was a great satisfaction to me that my friend and
colleague, Mr. Jones, also of the Chinese Evangelisation
Society, was led to take the same step; and we were both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
profoundly thankful that the separation took place without
the least breach of friendly feeling on either side. Indeed,
we had the joy of knowing that the step we took commended
itself to several members of the Committee,
although as a whole the Society could not come to our
position. Depending upon <span class="smcap">God</span> alone for supplies, we
were enabled to continue a measure of connection with
our former supporters, sending home journals, etc., for
publication as before, so long as the Society continued to
exist.</p>

<p>The step we had taken was not a little trying to faith.
I was not at all sure what <span class="smcap">God</span> would have me do, or
whether He would so meet my need as to enable me to
continue working as before. I had no friends whatever
from whom I expected supplies. I did not know what
means the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> might use; but I was willing to give up
all my time to the service of evangelisation among the
heathen, if by any means He would supply the smallest
amount on which I could live; and if He were not pleased
to do this, I was prepared to undertake whatever work
might be necessary to supply myself, giving all the time
that could be spared from such a calling to more distinctly
missionary efforts. But <span class="smcap">God</span> blessed and prospered me;
and how glad and thankful I felt when the separation was
really effected! I could look right up into my <span class="smcap">Father's</span>
face with a satisfied heart, ready, by His grace, to do the
next thing as He might teach me, and feeling very sure of
His loving care.</p>

<p>And how blessedly He did lead me on and provide for
me I can never, never tell. It was like a continuation of
some of my earlier home experiences. My faith was not
untried; it often, often failed, and I was so sorry and
ashamed of the failure to trust such a <span class="smcap">Father</span>. But oh!
I was learning to know Him. I would not even then have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
missed the trial. He became so near, so real, so intimate.
The occasional difficulty about funds never came from an
insufficient supply for personal needs, but in consequence
of ministering to the wants of scores of the hungry and
dying ones around us. And trials far more searching in
other ways quite eclipsed these difficulties; and being
deeper, brought forth in consequence richer fruits. How
glad one is now, not only to know, with dear Miss Havergal,
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"They who trust Him wholly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Find Him wholly true,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>but also that when we fail to trust fully He still remains
unchangingly faithful. He <i>is</i> wholly true whether
we trust or not. "If we believe not, He abideth faithful;
He cannot deny Himself." But oh, how we dishonour
our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> whenever we fail to trust Him, and what peace,
blessing, and triumph we lose in thus sinning against the
Faithful One! May we never again presume in anything
to doubt Him!</div>

<p>The year 1857 was a troublous time, and closed with the
notorious bombardment of Canton by the British, and the
commencement of our second Chinese war. Rumours of
trouble were everywhere rife, and in many places the
missionaries passed through not a little danger. In Ningpo
this was especially the case, and the preserving care of <span class="smcap">God</span>
in answer to prayer was consequently most marked. When
the awful news of the bombardment of Canton reached the
Cantonese in Ningpo their wrath and indignation knew no
bounds, and they immediately set to work to plot the
destruction of all the foreigners resident in the city and
neighbourhood. It was well known that many of the
foreigners were in the habit of meeting for worship every
Sunday evening at one of the missionary houses, and the
plan was to surround the place on a given occasion and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
make short work of all present, cutting off afterwards any
who might not be present.</p>

<p>The sanction of the Tao-t'ai, or chief civil magistrate of
the city, was easily obtained; and nothing remained to
hinder the execution of the plot, of which the foreigners
were of course entirely in ignorance. (A similar plot
against the Portuguese a few months later was carried out,
and between fifty and sixty were massacred in open daylight.)
It so happened, however, that one of those acquainted with
the conspiracy had a friend engaged in the service of the
missionaries; and anxious for his safety, he was led to warn
him of the coming danger, and urge his leaving foreign
employ. The servant made the matter known to his
master, and thus the little community became aware of
their peril. Realising the gravity of the situation, they
determined to meet together at the house of one of their
number to seek the protection of the Most High, and to
hide under the shadow of His wings. Nor did they thus
meet in vain.</p>

<p>At the very time we were praying the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was working.
He led an inferior mandarin, the Superintendent of Customs,
to call upon the Tao-t'ai, and remonstrate with him upon
the folly of permitting such an attempt, which he assured
him would rouse the foreigners in other places to come
with armed forces to avenge the death of their countrymen
and raze the city to the ground. The Tao-t'ai replied that,
when the foreigners came for that purpose, he should deny
all knowledge of or complicity in the plot, and so direct
their vengeance against the Cantonese, who would in their
turn be destroyed; "and thus," said he, "we shall get rid
of both Cantonese and foreigners by one stroke of policy."
The Superintendent of Customs assured him that all such
attempts at evasion would be useless; and, finally, the
Tao-t'ai sent to the Cantonese, withdrawing his permission,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and prohibiting the attack. This took place at the very
time when we were asking protection of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, though
we did not become acquainted with the facts until some
weeks later. Thus again we were led to prove that&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Sufficient is His arm alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And our defence is sure."</span><br />
</div>

<p>I cannot attempt to give any historical record of the
events of this period, but ere 1857 terminated Mr. Jones
and I were cheered by tokens of blessing. It is interesting
to recall the circumstances connected with the first profession
of faith in Christ, which encouraged us.</p>

<p>On one occasion I was preaching the glad tidings of
salvation through the finished work of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, when a
middle-aged man stood up, and testified before his
assembled countrymen to his faith in the power of the
Gospel.</p>

<p>"I have long sought for the Truth," said he earnestly,
"as my fathers did before me; but I have never found it.
I have travelled far and near, but without obtaining it. I
have found no rest in Confucianism, Buddhism, or Taoism;
but I do find rest in what I have heard here to-night.
Henceforth I am a believer in <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>."</p>

<p>This man was one of the leading officers of a sect of
reformed Buddhists in Ningpo. A short time after his
confession of faith in the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> there was a meeting of
the sect over which he had formerly presided. I accompanied
him to that meeting, and there, to his former co-religionists,
he testified of the peace he had obtained in
believing. Soon after, one of his former companions was
converted and baptized. Both now sleep in <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>. The
first of these two long continued to preach to his countrymen
the glad tidings of great joy. A few nights after his
conversion he asked how long this Gospel had been known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in England. He was told that we had known it for some
hundreds of years.</p>

<p>"What!" said he, amazed; "is it possible that for
hundreds of years you have had the knowledge of these
glad tidings in your possession, and yet have only now
come to preach it to us? My father sought after the
Truth for more than twenty years, and died without finding
it. Oh, why did you not come sooner?"</p>

<p>A whole generation has passed away since that mournful
inquiry was made; but how many, alas! might repeat
the same question to-day? More than two hundred
millions in the meanwhile have been swept into eternity,
without an offer of salvation. How long shall this continue,
and the <span class="smcap">Master's</span> words, "To every creature," remain
unheeded?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>TIMELY SUPPLIES</h3>


<div class='cap'>NOT infrequently our <span class="smcap">God</span> brings His people into
difficulties on purpose that they may come to
know Him as they could not otherwise do. Then He
reveals Himself as "a very present help in trouble," and
makes the heart glad indeed at each fresh revelation of a
<span class="smcap">Father's</span> faithfulness. We who only see so small a part
of the sweet issues of trial often feel that we would not
for anything have missed them; how much more shall we
bless and magnify His Name when all the hidden things
are brought to light!</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1857, just one year after I came to
settle in Ningpo, a little incident occurred that did much
to strengthen our faith in the loving-kindness and ever-watchful
care of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>A brother in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the Rev. John Quarterman, of
the American Presbyterian Mission North, was taken with
virulent small-pox, and it was my mournful privilege to
nurse him through his suffering illness to its fatal close.
When all was over, it became necessary to lay aside the
garments worn while nursing, for fear of conveying the infection
to others. Not having sufficient money in hand to
purchase what was needful in order to make this change,
prayer was the only resource. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> answered it by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the unexpected arrival of a long-lost box of clothing from
Swatow, that had remained in the care of the Rev. William Burns
when I left him for Shanghai, in the early summer
of the previous year. The arrival of the things just at
this juncture was as appropriate as it was remarkable,
and brought a sweet sense of the <span class="smcap">Father's</span> own providing.</p>

<p>About two months later the following was penned:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class='right'>
<i>November 18th, 1857.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Many seem to think that I am very poor. This
certainly is true enough in one sense, but I thank <span class="smcap">God</span>
it is "as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet
possessing all things." And my <span class="smcap">God</span> shall supply <i>all</i> my
need; to Him be all the glory. I would not, if I could,
be otherwise than I am&mdash;entirely dependent myself upon
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and used as a channel of help to others.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 4th inst., our regular home mail
arrived. That morning we supplied, as usual, a breakfast
to the destitute poor, who came to the number of seventy.
Sometimes they do not reach forty, at others again exceeding
eighty. They come to us every day, <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> Day
excepted, for then we cannot manage to attend to them
and get through all our other duties too. Well, on that
Saturday morning we paid all expenses, and provided
ourselves for the morrow, after which we had not a single
dollar left between us. How the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was going to
provide for Monday we knew not; but over our mantelpiece
hung two scrolls in the Chinese character&mdash;<i>Ebenezer</i>,
"Hitherto hath the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> helped us"; and <i>Jehovah-Jireh</i>,
"The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will provide"&mdash;and He kept us from doubting
for a moment. That very day the mail came in, <i>a week
sooner than was expected</i>, and Mr. Jones received a bill for
two hundred and fourteen dollars. We thanked <span class="smcap">God</span> and
took courage. The bill was taken to a merchant, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
although there is usually a delay of several days in getting
the change, this time he said, "Send down on Monday."
We sent, and though he had not been able to buy all the
dollars, he let us have seventy on account; so all was well.
Oh, it is sweet to live thus directly dependent upon the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, who never fails us!</p>

<p>On Monday the poor had their breakfast as usual, for we
had not told them not to come, being assured that it was
the <span class="smcap">Lord's</span> work, and that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> would provide. We
could not help our eyes filling with tears of gratitude when
we saw not only our own needs supplied, but the widow
and the orphan, the blind and the lame, the friendless and
the destitute, together provided for by the bounty of Him
who feeds the ravens. "O magnify the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with me,
and let us exalt His Name together.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Taste and see
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in
Him. O fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, ye His saints: for there is no
want to them that fear Him. The young lions do
lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall not want any good thing"&mdash;and if not good, why
want it?</p>

<p>But even two hundred dollars cannot last for ever, and
by New Year's Day supplies were again getting low. At
last, on January 6th, 1858, only one solitary cash remained&mdash;the
twentieth part of a penny&mdash;in the joint possession
of Mr. Jones and myself; but though tried we looked to
<span class="smcap">God</span> once again to manifest His gracious care. Enough
provision was found in the house to supply a meagre
breakfast; after which, having neither food for the rest of
the day, nor money to buy any, we could only betake
ourselves to Him who was able to supply all our need
with the petition, "Give us this day our daily bread."</p>

<p>After prayer and deliberation we thought that perhaps
we ought to dispose of something we possessed in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
meet our immediate requirements. But on looking round
we saw nothing that we could well spare, and little that the
Chinese would purchase for ready money. Credit to any
extent we might have had, could we conscientiously have
availed ourselves of it, but this we felt to be unscriptural
in itself, as well as inconsistent with the position we were
in. We had, indeed, one article&mdash;an iron stove&mdash;which
we knew the Chinese would readily purchase; but we
much regretted the necessity of parting with it. At length,
however, we set out to the founder's, and after a walk of
some distance came to the river, which we had intended to
cross by a floating bridge of boats; but here the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shut up our path. The bridge had been carried away
during the preceding night, and the river was only passable
by means of a ferry, the fare for which was two cash
each person. As we only possessed one cash, our course
clearly was to return and await <span class="smcap">God's</span> own interposition
on our behalf.</p>

<p>Upon reaching home, we found that Mrs. Jones had gone
with the children to dine at a friend's house, in accordance
with an invitation accepted some days previously. Mr.
Jones, though himself included in the invitation, refused
now to go and leave me to fast alone. So we set to work
and carefully searched the cupboards; and though there
was nothing to eat, we found a small packet of cocoa,
which, with a little hot water, somewhat revived us. After
this we again cried to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in our trouble, and the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> heard and saved us out of all our distresses. For
while we were still upon our knees a letter arrived from
England containing a remittance.</p>

<p>This timely supply not only met the immediate and
urgent need of the day; for in the assured confidence that
<span class="smcap">God</span>, whose we were and whom we served, would not put
to shame those whose whole and only trust was in Himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>.
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'my'">My</ins> marriage had been previously arranged to take place
just fourteen days after this date. And this expectation
was not disappointed; for "the mountains shall depart,
and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall not depart
from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace be
removed." And although during subsequent years our
faith was often exercised, and sometimes severely, He ever
proved faithful to His promise, and never suffered us to
lack any good thing.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, was there a union that more fully
realised the blessed truth, "Whoso findeth a wife findeth
a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>." My
dear wife was not only a precious gift to me; <span class="smcap">God</span> blessed
her to many others during the twelve eventful years
through which she was spared to those that loved her and
to China.</p>

<p>Hers had been a life connection with missionary work
in that great empire; for her father, the loved and devoted
Samuel Dyer, was amongst the very earliest representatives
of the London Mission in the East. He reached the Straits
as early as 1827, and for sixteen years laboured assiduously
amongst the Chinese in Penang and Singapore, completing
at the same time a valuable fount of Chinese metallic type,
the first of the kind that had then been attempted. Dying
in 1843, it was never Mr. Dyers privilege to realise his
hopes of ultimately being able to settle on Chinese soil;
but his children lived to see the country opened to the
Gospel, and to take their share in the great work that had
been so dear to his heart. At the time of her marriage,
my dear wife had been already living for several years in
Ningpo with her friend, Miss Aldersey, in whose varied
missionary operations she was well qualified to render
valuable assistance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>GOD A REFUGE FOR US</h3>


<div class='cap'>A SOMEWHAT different though not less manifest answer
to prayer was vouchsafed early in the year 1859. My
dear wife was brought very low by illness, and at last all
hope of recovery seemed gone. Every remedy tried had
proved unavailing; and Dr. Parker, who was in attendance,
had nothing more to suggest. Life was ebbing fast away.
The only ground of hope was that <span class="smcap">God</span> might yet see fit to
raise her up, in answer to believing but submissive prayer.</div>

<p>The afternoon for the usual prayer meeting among the
missionaries had arrived, and I sent in a request for prayer,
which was most warmly responded to. Just at this time a
remedy that had not yet been tried was suggested to my
mind, and I felt that I must hasten to consult Dr. Parker
as to the propriety of using it. It was a moment of anguish.
The hollow temples, sunken eyes, and pinched features
denoted the near approach of death; and it seemed more
than questionable as to whether life would hold out until
my return. It was nearly two miles to Dr. Parker's house,
and every moment appeared long. On my way thither,
while wrestling mightily with <span class="smcap">God</span> in prayer, the precious
words were brought with power to my soul, "Call upon Me
in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shall
glorify Me." I was at once enabled to plead them in faith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and the result was deep, deep, unspeakable peace and joy.
All consciousness of distance was gone. Dr. Parker
cordially approved of the use of the means suggested, but
upon arriving at home I saw at a glance that the desired
change had taken place in the absence of this or any other
remedy. The pinched aspect of the countenance had given
place to the calmness of tranquil slumber, and not one
unfavourable symptom remained to retard recovery to health
and strength.</p>

<p>Spared thus in answer to prayer the loss of my own
loved one, it was with added sympathy and sorrow that I
felt for Dr. Parker, when, in the autumn of the same
year, his own wife was very suddenly removed. It being
necessary for the doctor to return at once with his motherless
children to Glasgow, temporary arrangements had to
be made for the conduct of the Mission Hospital in
Ningpo, for which he alone had been responsible. Under
these circumstances he requested me to take up the work,
at least so far as the dispensary was concerned. After a
few days' waiting upon the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for guidance, I felt constrained
to undertake not only the dispensary work, but also
that of the hospital; relying solely upon the faithfulness of
a prayer-hearing <span class="smcap">God</span> to furnish the means required for its
support.</p>

<p>The funds for the maintenance of the hospital had
hitherto been supplied by the proceeds of the doctor's
foreign medical practice; and with his departure these
ceased. But had not <span class="smcap">God</span> said that whatever we ask in
the Name of the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> shall be done? And are
we not told to seek first the kingdom of <span class="smcap">God</span>, not means
to advance it, and that all these things shall be added to
us? Such promises were surely sufficient. Eight days
before entering upon this responsibility I had not the
remotest idea of ever doing so; still less could friends at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
home have anticipated it. But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had foreseen the
need, and already funds were on the way to supply it.</p>

<p>At times there were not less than fifty in-patients in the
hospital, besides a large number who daily attended the
out-patient department. Thirty beds were ordinarily allotted
to free patients and their attendants; and about as
many to opium-smokers, who paid for their board while
being cured of the habit. As all the wants of the sick in
the wards were supplied gratuitously, in addition to the
remedial appliances needed for the out-patient work, the
daily expenses were considerable; besides which, a number
of native attendants were required, involving their support.</p>

<p>When Dr. Parker handed the hospital over to me he
was able to leave money that would meet the salaries and
working expenses of the current month, and little more.
Being unable to guarantee their support, his native staff
retired; and then I mentioned the circumstances to the
members of our little church, some of whom volunteered
to help me, depending, like myself, upon the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; and
they with me continued to wait upon <span class="smcap">God</span> that in some
way or other He would provide for His own work. Day
by day the stores diminished, and they were all but exhausted
when one day a remarkable letter reached me
from a friend in England which contained a cheque for
&pound;50. The letter stated that the sender had recently lost
his father, and had inherited his property; that not desiring
to increase his personal expenditure, he wished to hold
the money which had now been left to him to further the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> work. He enclosed the &pound;50, saying that I might
know of some special need for it; but leaving me free to
use it for my own support, or in any way that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
might lead me; only asking to know how it was applied,
and whether there was need for more.</p>

<p>After a little season of thanksgiving with my dear wife,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I called my native helpers into our little chapel, and translated
to them the letter. I need not say how rejoiced they
were, and that we together praised <span class="smcap">God</span>. They returned
to their work in the hospital with overflowing hearts, and
told out to the patients what a <span class="smcap">God</span> was ours; appealing
to them whether their idols had ever helped them so.
Both helpers and patients were blessed spiritually through
this remarkable provision, and from that time the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
provided all that was necessary for carrying on the institution,
in addition to what was needed for the maintenance
of my own family, and for sustaining other branches of
missionary work under my care. When, nine months
later, I was obliged through failure of health to relinquish
this charge, I was able to leave more funds in hand for
the support of the hospital than were forthcoming at the
time I undertook it.</p>

<p>But not only were pecuniary supplies vouchsafed in
answer to prayer&mdash;many lives were spared; persons apparently
in hopeless stages of disease were restored, and
success was given in cases of serious and dangerous
operations. In the case of one poor man, whose legs
were amputated under very unfavourable circumstances,
healthy action took place with such rapidity that both
wounds were healed in less than two weeks. And more
permanent benefits than these were conferred. Many
were convinced of the truth of Christianity; not a few
sought the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in faith and prayer, and experienced the
power of the Great Physician to cure the sin-sick soul.
During the nine months above alluded to sixteen patients
from the hospital were baptized, and more than thirty
others became candidates for admission into one or other
of the Christian churches in the city.</p>

<p>Thus the year 1860 began with openings on all hands,
but time and strength were sadly too limited to admit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
their being used to the best advantage. For some time
the help of additional workers had been a much-felt need;
and in January very definite prayer was made to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
of the harvest that He would thrust forth more labourers
into this special portion of the great world-field. Writing
to relatives at home in England, under date of January
16th, 1860, I thus expressed the deep longing of our
hearts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Do you know any earnest, devoted young men desirous
of serving <span class="smcap">God</span> in China, who&mdash;not wishing for more than
their actual support&mdash;would be willing to come out and
labour here? Oh, for four or five such helpers! They
would probably begin to preach in Chinese in six months
time; and in answer to prayer the necessary means for
their support would be found.</p></div>

<p>But no one came to help us then; and under the
incessant physical and mental strain involved, in the care
of the hospital during Dr. Parker's absence, as well as the
continued discharge of my other missionary duties, my
own health began rapidly to fail, and it became a serious
question as to whether it would not be needful to return
to England for a time.</p>

<p>It was hard to face this possibility. The growing
church and work seemed to need our presence, and it was
no small trial to part from those whom we had learned so
truly to love in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. Thirty or forty native Christians
had been gathered into the recently organised church;
and the well-filled meetings, and the warm-hearted earnestness
of the converts, all bespoke a future of much promise.
At last, however, completely prostrated by repeated attacks
of illness, the only hope of restoration seemed to lie in a
voyage to England and a brief stay in its more bracing
climate; and this necessity, painful though it seemed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the time, proved to be only another opportunity for the
manifestation of the faithfulness and loving care of Him
"who worketh all things after the counsel of His own
will."</p>

<p>As heretofore, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was present with His aid. The
means for our journey were supplied, and that so liberally
that we were able to bring with us a native Christian to
assist in translation or other literary work, and to instruct
in the language such helpers as the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> might raise up
for the extension of the Mission. That He would give us
fellow-labourers we had no doubt; for we had been
enabled to seek them from Him in earnest and believing
prayer for many months previously.</p>

<p>The day before leaving China we wrote as follows to
our friend W. T. Berger, Esq., whom we had known in
England, and who had ever strengthened our hands in the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> while in that distant land:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are bringing with us a young Chinese brother to
assist in literary work, and I hope also in teaching the
dialect to those whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> may induce to return
with us."</p>

<p>And throughout the voyage our earnest cry to <span class="smcap">God</span> was
that He would overrule our stay at home for good to
China, and make it instrumental in raising up at least five
helpers to labour in the province of <span class="smcap">Cheh-kiang</span>.</p>

<p>The way in which it pleased the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to answer these
earnest and believing prayers, and the "exceeding abundantly"
with which He crowned them, we shall now sketch
in brief outline.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>A NEW AGENCY NEEDED</h3>


<div class='cap'>"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your
ways My ways, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. For as the
heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher
than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
How true are these words! When the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is bringing
in great blessing in the best possible way, how oftentimes
our unbelieving hearts are feeling, if not saying, like Jacob
of old, "All these things are against me." Or we are filled
with fear, as were the disciples when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, walking on
the waters, drew near to quiet the troubled sea, and to
bring them quickly to their desired haven. And yet mere
common-sense ought to tell us that He, whose way is perfect,
<i>can</i> make no mistakes; that He who has promised to
"perfect that which concerneth" us, and whose minute care
counts the very hairs of our heads, and forms for us our
circumstances, <i>must</i> know better than we the way to forward
our truest interests and to glorify His own Name.</div>

<div class='poem'><br />
"Blind unbelief is <i>sure</i> to err<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And scan His work in vain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><span class="smcap">God</span> is His own Interpreter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And He will make it plain."</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>To me it seemed a great calamity that failure of health
compelled my relinquishing work for <span class="smcap">God</span> in China, just
when it was more fruitful than ever before; and to leave
the little band of Christians in Ningpo, needing much care
and teaching, was a great sorrow. Nor was the sorrow
lessened when, on reaching England, medical testimony
assured me that return to China, at least for years to come,
was impossible. Little did I then realise that the long
separation from China was a necessary step towards the
formation of a work which <span class="smcap">God</span> would bless as He has
blessed the <span class="smcap">China Inland Mission</span>. While in the field,
the pressure of claims immediately around me was so great
that I could not think much of the still greater needs of the
regions farther inland; and, if they were thought of, could
do nothing for them. But while detained for some years in
England, daily viewing the whole country on the large map
on the wall of my study, I was as near to the vast regions
of Inland China as to the smaller districts in which I had
laboured personally for <span class="smcap">God</span>; and prayer was often the only
resource by which the burdened heart could gain any
relief.</p>

<p>As a long absence from China appeared inevitable, the
next question was how best to serve China while in England,
and this led to my engaging for several years, with
the late Rev. F. F. Gough of the C. M. S., in the revision of
a version of the New Testament in the colloquial of Ningpo
for the British and Foreign Bible Society. In undertaking
this work, in my short-sightedness I saw nothing beyond
the use that the Book, and the marginal references, would be
to the native Christians; but I have often seen since that,
without those months of feeding and feasting on the Word
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, I should have been quite unprepared to form, on
its present basis, a mission like the <span class="smcap">China Inland Mission</span>.</p>

<p>In the study of that Divine Word I learned that, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
obtain successful labourers, not elaborate appeals for help,
but, <i>first</i>, earnest <i>prayer to <span class="smcap">God</span> to thrust forth labourers</i>,
and, <i>second</i>, the deepening of the spiritual life of the
church, so that <i>men should be unable to stay at home</i>, were
what was needed. I saw that the Apostolic plan was not
to raise ways and means, but <i>to go and do the work</i>, trusting
in His sure Word who has said, "Seek ye <i>first</i> the Kingdom
of <span class="smcap">God</span> and His righteousness, and all these things shall be
added unto you."</p>

<p>In the meantime the prayer for workers for <span class="smcap">Cheh-kiang</span>
was being answered. The first, Mr. Meadows, sailed for
China with his young wife in January 1862, through the
kind co-operation and aid of our friend Mr. Berger. The
second left England in 1864, having her passage provided
by the Foreign Evangelisation Society. The third and
fourth reached Ningpo on July 24th, 1865. A fifth soon
followed them, reaching Ningpo in September 1865. Thus
the prayer for the five workers was fully answered; and we
were encouraged to look to <span class="smcap">God</span> for still greater things.</p>

<p>Months of earnest prayer and not a few abortive efforts
had resulted in a deep conviction that <i>a special agency was
essential</i> for the evangelisation of Inland China. At this
time I had not only the daily help of prayer and conference
with my beloved friend and fellow-worker the late Rev. F.
F. Gough, but also invaluable aid and counsel from Mr.
and Mrs. Berger, with whom I and my dear wife (whose
judgment and piety were of priceless value at this juncture)
spent many days in prayerful deliberation. The grave
difficulty of possibly interfering with existing missionary
operations at home was foreseen; but it was concluded
that, by simple trust in <span class="smcap">God</span>, suitable agency might be raised
up and sustained without interfering injuriously with any
existing work. I had also a growing conviction that <span class="smcap">God</span>
would have <i>me</i> to seek from Him the needed workers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to go forth with them. But for a long time unbelief
hindered my taking the first step.</p>

<p>How inconsistent unbelief always is! I had no doubt
that, if I prayed for workers, "<i>in</i> the Name" of the <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus Christ</span>, they would be given me. I had no doubt
that, in answer to such prayer, the means for our going
forth would be provided, and that doors would be opened
before us in unreached parts of the Empire. But I had not
then learned to trust <span class="smcap">God</span> for <i>keeping</i> power and grace for
myself, so no wonder that I could not trust Him to keep
others who might be prepared to go with me. I feared that
in the midst of the dangers, difficulties, and trials which
would necessarily be connected with such a work, some who
were comparatively inexperienced Christians might break
down, and bitterly reproach me for having encouraged them
to undertake an enterprise for which they were unequal.</p>

<p>Yet, what was I to do? The feeling of blood-guiltiness
became more and more intense. Simply because I refused
to ask for them, the labourers did not come forward&mdash;did
not go out to China&mdash;and every day tens of thousands were
passing away to Christless graves! Perishing China so
filled my heart and mind that there was no rest by day,
and little sleep by night, till health broke down. At the
invitation of my beloved and honoured friend, Mr. George
Pearse (then of the Stock Exchange), I went to spend a
few days with him in Brighton.</p>

<p>On Sunday, June 25th, 1865, unable to bear the sight
of a congregation of a thousand or more Christian people
rejoicing in their own security, while millions were perishing
for lack of knowledge, I wandered out on the sands alone,
in great spiritual agony; and there the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> conquered
my unbelief, and I surrendered myself to <span class="smcap">God</span> for this
service. I told Him that all the responsibility as to issues
and consequences must rest with Him; that as His servant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it was mine to obey and to follow Him&mdash;His, to direct, to
care for, and to guide me and those who might labour with
me. Need I say that peace at once flowed into my burdened
heart? There and then I asked Him for twenty-four
fellow-workers, two for each of eleven inland provinces
which were without a missionary, and two for Mongolia;
and writing the petition on the margin of the Bible I had
with me, I returned home with a heart enjoying rest such
as it had been a stranger to for months, and with an assurance
that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> would bless His own work and that I
should share in the blessing. I had previously prayed, and
asked prayer, that workers might be raised up for the eleven
then unoccupied provinces, and thrust forth and provided
for, but had not surrendered myself to be their leader.</p>

<p>About this time, with the help of my dear wife, I wrote
the little book, <i>China's Spiritual Need and Claims</i>.
Every paragraph was steeped in prayer. With the help of
Mr. Berger, who had given valued aid in the revision of
the manuscript, and who bore the expense of printing an
edition of 3000 copies, they were soon put in circulation.
I spoke publicly of the proposed work as opportunity permitted,
specially at the Perth and Mildmay Conferences of
1865, and continued in prayer for fellow-workers, who were
soon raised up, and after due correspondence were invited
to my home, then in the East of London. When one
house became insufficient, the occupant of the adjoining
house removed, and I was able to rent it; and when that
in its turn became insufficient, further accommodation was
provided close by. Soon there were a number of men and
women under preparatory training, and engaging in evangelistic
work which tested in some measure their qualifications
as soul-winners.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE FORMATION OF THE C. I. M.</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was thus that in the year 1865 the <span class="smcap">China Inland
Mission</span> was organised; and the workers already in
the field were incorporated into it. W. T. Berger, Esq.,
then residing at Saint Hill, near East Grinstead, without
whose help and encouragement I could not have gone
forward, undertook the direction of the home department
of the work during my anticipated absence in China; and
I proposed, as soon as arrangements could be completed,
to go out with the volunteers and take the direction of the
work in the field. For the support of the workers already
in China, our friends at home were sending in unsolicited
contributions from time to time, and every need was met.</div>

<p>We had now, however, to look forward to the outgoing
of a party of sixteen or seventeen, and estimated that from
&pound;1500 to &pound;2000 might be required to cover outfits,
passage-money, and initial expenses. I wrote a little
pamphlet, calling it "Occasional Paper, No. I." (intending
in successive numbers to give to donors and friends
accounts of the work wrought through us in China), and
in that paper stated the anticipated needs for floating the
enterprise. I expected that <span class="smcap">God</span> would incline the hearts of
some of the readers to send contributions: I had determined
never to use personal solicitation, or to make collections, or
to issue collecting-books. Missionary-boxes were thought unobjectionable,
and we had a few prepared for those who might
ask for them, and have continued to use them ever since.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was February 6th, 1866, when I sent my manuscript
of "Occasional Paper, No. I.," with a design for the cover,
to the printer. From delays in engraving and printing,
it was March 12th when the bales of pamphlets were
delivered at my house. Now on February 6th a daily
prayer-meeting, from 12 to 1 o'clock, had been commenced,
to ask for the needed funds. And that we had
not asked in vain, the following extract from "Occasional
Paper, No. II." will show:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The receipts for 1864 were &pound;51:14s.; for 1865,
from January to June, &pound;221:12:6, besides two free passages;
from June to December, &pound;923:12:8. Hindrances
having occurred, the MS. of the "Occasional Paper, No. I."
was not completed till February 6th, 1866. Up to this
time we had received (from December 30th) &pound;170:8:3.</p>

<p>"We felt much encouraged by the receipt of so much
money in little more than a month, as it was entirely unsolicited
by us&mdash;save from <span class="smcap">God</span>. But it was also evident
that we must ask the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to do yet greater things for us,
or it would be impossible for a party of from ten to sixteen
to leave in the middle of May. <i>Daily united prayer was therefore

passages of as many as He would have to go out in May.</p>

<p>"Owing to the delays mentioned above in the printing of
the 'Occasional Paper,' it was not ready for the publisher
until March 12th. On this day I again examined my
mission cash-book, and the comparison of the result of
the two similar periods of one month and six days each,
one before and one after special prayer for &pound;1500 to
&pound;2000, was very striking:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>"This, it will be noticed, was <i>previous</i> to the circulation
of the 'Occasional Paper,' and, consequently, was not the
result of it. It was the response of a faithful <span class="smcap">God</span> to the
united prayers of those whom He had called to serve Him
in the Gospel of His dear <span class="smcap">Son</span>.</p>

<p>"We can now compare with these two periods a third of the
same extent. From March 12th to April 18th the receipts
were &pound;529, showing that when <span class="smcap">God</span> had supplied the
special need, the special supply also ceased. Truly there is a
<span class="smcap">Living God</span>, and <span class="smcap">He</span> is the hearer and answerer of prayer."</p>

<p>But this gracious answer to prayer made it a little
difficult to circulate "Occasional Paper, No. I.," for it
stated as a need that which was already supplied. The
difficulty was obviated by the issue with each copy of a
coloured inset stating that the funds for outfit and passage
were already in hand in answer to prayer. We were
reminded of the difficulty of Moses&mdash;not a very common
one in the present day&mdash;and of the proclamation he had
to send through the camp to the people to prepare no
more for the building of the Tabernacle, as the gifts in
hand were already too much. We are convinced that if
there were <i>less</i> solicitation for money and <i>more</i> dependence
upon the power of the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> and upon the deepening
of spiritual life, the experience of Moses would be a
common one in every branch of Christian work.</p>

<p>Preparations for sailing to China were at once proceeded
with. About this time I was asked to give a lecture on
China in a village not very far from London, and agreed to
do so on condition that there should be no collection, and
that this should be announced on the bills. The gentleman
who invited me, and who kindly presided as chairman, said
he had never had that condition imposed before. He accepted
it, however, and the bills were issued accordingly for
the 2nd or 3rd of May. With the aid of a large map, something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the extent and population and deep spiritual need
of China was presented, and many were evidently impressed.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting the chairman said that by
my request it had been intimated on the bills that there
would be no collection; but he felt that many present
would be distressed and burdened if they had not the
opportunity of contributing something towards the good
work proposed. He trusted that as the proposition emanated
entirely from himself, and expressed, he felt sure, the
feelings of many in the audience, I should not object to it.
I begged, however, that the condition agreed to might be
carried out; pointing out among other reasons for making
no collection, that the very reason adduced by our kind
chairman was, to my mind, one of the strongest for not
making it. My wish was, not that those present should be
relieved by making such contribution as might there and
then be convenient, under the influence of a present
emotion; but that each one should go home burdened with
the deep need of China, and ask of <span class="smcap">God</span> what He would
have them to do. If, after thought and prayer, they were
satisfied that a pecuniary contribution was what He wanted
of them, it could be given to any Missionary Society having
agents in China; or it might be posted to our London
office; but that perhaps in many cases what <span class="smcap">God</span> wanted
was <i>not</i> a money contribution, but personal consecration to
His service abroad; or the giving up of son or daughter&mdash;more
precious than silver or gold&mdash;to His service. I added
that I thought the tendency of a collection was to leave the
impression that the all-important thing was <i>money</i>, whereas
no amount of money could convert a single soul; that what
was needed was that men and women filled with the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span> should give <i>themselves</i> to the work: for the support
of such there would never be a lack of funds. As my wish
was evidently very strong, the chairman kindly yielded to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
it, and closed the meeting. He told me, however, at the
supper-table, that he thought it was a mistake on my part,
and that, notwithstanding all I had said, a few persons had
put some little contributions into his hands.</p>

<p>Next morning at breakfast, my kind host came in a little
late, and acknowledged to not having had a very good night.
After breakfast he asked me to his study, and giving me
the contributions handed to him the night before, said,
"I thought last night, Mr. Taylor, that you were in the
wrong about a collection; I am now convinced you were
quite right. As I thought in the night of that stream of
souls in China ever passing onward into the dark, I could
only cry as you suggested, '<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, what wilt Thou have <i>me</i>
to do?' I think I have obtained the guidance I sought,
and here it is." He handed me a cheque for &pound;500,
adding that if there had been a collection he would have
given a few pounds to it, but now this cheque was the
result of having spent no small part of the night in prayer.</p>

<p>I need scarcely say how surprised and thankful I was
for this gift. I had received at the breakfast-table a letter
from Messrs. Killick, Martin and Co., shipping agents, in
which they stated that they could offer us the whole
passenger accommodation of the ship <i>Lammermuir</i>. I went
direct to the ship, found it in every way suitable, and paid
the cheque on account. As above stated, the funds
deemed needed had been already in hand for some time;
but the coincidence of the simultaneous offer of the ship
accommodation and this munificent gift&mdash;<span class="smcap">God's</span> "exceeding
abundantly"&mdash;greatly encouraged my heart.</p>

<p>On the 26th of May we sailed for China in the <i>Lammermuir</i>,
a missionary party of 16 (besides my four children and
their nurse, and Miss Bausum (afterwards Mrs. Barchet<ins title="Transcriber's Note: This closing parenthesis missing in original">)</ins>); in
all 22 passengers. Mr. Berger took charge of the home
department, and thus the C. I. M. was fully inaugurated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE MISSION IN 1894</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE events sketched in the last two chapters have
been more fully delineated by Miss Guinness in
her interesting <i>Story of the China Inland Mission</i>, which
continues its history to the present date. It is indeed
a record of the goodness of <span class="smcap">God</span>, every remembrance of
which calls for gratitude and praise. We can only here
briefly mention a few facts, referring our readers to Miss
Guinness's work for all details.</div>

<p>After a voyage of many mercies the <i>Lammermuir</i> party
safely reached China, and during the first ten years stations
and out-stations were opened in many cities and towns in
four provinces which hitherto had been unreached by the
Gospel. At home Mr. and Mrs. Berger continued their
devoted service until March 19th, 1872, I having returned
to England the year before. Shortly after this the London
Council was formed, which has now for several years been
assisted by an auxiliary Council of ladies. A Scotch
Council was also formed in Glasgow a few years ago.</p>

<p>A visit to America in 1888 issued in the formation of
the Council for North America, and a similar Council for
Australasia was commenced in Melbourne two years later.
In the field a China Council was organised in 1886, composed
of senior missionaries who meet quarterly in Shanghai.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Closely associated with the C. I. M. are seven Committees&mdash;in
England, Norway, Sweden (two), Finland, Germany, and
the United States&mdash;which send out and support their own
missionaries, who in China have the assistance of the
educational and other advantages of the C. I. M., and
who work under its direction.</p>

<p>The staff of the Mission, in May 1893, consisted of
552 missionaries (including wives and associates). There
were also 326 native helpers (95 of whom were unpaid),
working as pastors, evangelists, teachers, colporteurs, Bible-women,
etc., in 14 different provinces.</p>

<p>Duly qualified candidates for missionary labour are
accepted without restriction as to denomination, provided
they are sound in the faith in all fundamental truths:
these go out in dependence upon <span class="smcap">God</span> for temporal supplies,
with the clear understanding that the officers of the Mission
do not guarantee any income whatever; and knowing that
as they will not go into debt, they can only minister to
them as the funds sent in from time to time will allow.
But we praise <span class="smcap">God</span> that during the past twenty-eight years
such ministry has always been possible; our <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>has</i>
supplied all our need, and has withheld no good thing.</p>

<p>All the expenses of the Mission at home and abroad
are met by voluntary contributions, sent to the offices of
the Mission without personal solicitation, by those who
wish to aid in this effort to spread the knowledge of the
Gospel throughout China. The income for the year 1892
was about &pound;34,000 from all sources&mdash;Great Britain, the
Continent of Europe, North America, Australasia, China,
etc.</p>

<p>Some of the missionaries having private property have
gone out at their own expense, and do not take anything
from the Mission funds.</p>

<p>Stations have been opened in ten of the eleven provinces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
which were previously without Protestant missionaries; from
one of these, however, we have had to retire. The eleventh
province has been visited several times, and it is hoped
that in it permanent work may soon be begun.</p>

<p>More than 200 stations and out-stations have been
opened in fourteen of the eighteen provinces, in all of
which stations either missionaries or native labourers are
resident. Over 6000 converts have been baptized from
the commencement, some 4000 of whom are now living
and in fellowship.</p>


<h3><br />THE MISSION IN 1902</h3>

<p>The year 1894, in which the first edition of <i>A Retrospect</i>
appeared, was marked by the erection of large and commodious
premises for the work of the Mission, and early
in the following year the houses in Pyrland Road, which
had so long formed the home of the Mission in England,
were vacated, and <span class="smcap">Newington Green, London, N.</span>, became
the address of the Mission offices and home.</p>

<p>From that date until the Boxer outbreak of 1900 the
Mission made steady progress, the development of the work
in China being accompanied by corresponding developments
in the home departments of the Mission in England,
America, and Australasia.</p>

<p>In January 1900, before the Boxer outbreak, there were
in connection with the Mission, 811 missionaries, including
wives and associates; 171 stations; 223 out-stations; 387
chapels; 581 paid native helpers; 193 unpaid native
helpers; 8557 communicants in fellowship, 12,964 having
been baptized from the commencement. There were 266
organised churches; 788 boarding scholars; 1382 day
scholars; 6 hospitals; 18 dispensaries; and 46 opium
refuges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>During the terrible year of 1900, when no fewer than
135 missionaries and 53 missionaries' children and many
thousands of Chinese Christians were cruelly murdered,
the China Inland Mission lost 58 missionaries and 21
children. The records of these unparalleled times of
suffering have been told in <i>Martyred Missionaries of the
China Inland Mission</i> and in <i>Last Letters</i>, both of which
books will be found advertised at the end of this volume.
Apart from loss of life, there was an immense amount of
Mission property destroyed, and the missionaries were
compelled to retire from their stations in most parts of
China.</p>

<p>The doors closed by this outbreak have all been reopened
in the goodness of <span class="smcap">God</span>. In those districts which suffered
most from the massacres the work has largely been one of
reorganisation; but throughout China generally there has
been a spirit of awakening and a time of enlarged opportunity;
which is a loud call for more men and women to
volunteer to step into the gaps and fill the places of those
who have fallen.</p>

<p>Among recent developments we would specially mention
the opening of a new home centre at Philadelphia, U.S.A.
The total income of the Mission for 1901 was &pound;53,633 =
$257,712, and the total received in England alone, for 1902,
was &pound;51,446 = $246,912. The total membership of the
Mission in June 1902 was 761.</p>

<p>Current information about the progress of the work in
China may be obtained from <i>China's Millions</i>, the organ of
the Mission. It is published monthly, and may be ordered
through any bookseller from Messrs. Morgan and Scott, 12
Paternoster Buildings, E.C., for 1s. per year, or direct by
post from the offices of the Mission, Newington Green,
London, N., for 1s. 6d. per annum.</p>

<p>The Australasian edition of <i>China's Millions</i> may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ordered at the same price from M. L. Hutchinson, Little
Collins Street, or from the Mission Offices, 267 Collins
Street, Melbourne. The North American edition will be
sent post free from the Mission Offices, 507 Church Street,
Toronto, for 50 cents per annum.</p>

<p>Prayer meetings on behalf of the work in China are
held at the principal home centres of the Mission, as
follows: Every Saturday afternoon from 4 to 6 o'clock, at
Newington Green, London. Every Friday evening at 8
o'clock, at 507 Church Street, Toronto. Every Saturday
afternoon at 4 o'clock, in the Office, 267 Collins Street,
Melbourne. A hearty invitation to attend any one of these
meetings is given to any one residing in or visiting any of
these cities.</p>
